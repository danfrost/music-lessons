# Chapter Zero

_This draft is for feedback - I just need coherent words and some good examples to show that this disruption thing happens again and again._

Plan:
1. Music example of disruption (briefly)
2. Non-music examlpes of disruption
3. Temper the argument - not everything has changed, but sometimes it does
4. We can use music as a lens because what we see in the arguments for/against disruption of this industry and what we see in the human and market behaviours (I think) applies to many other industries.

What is industry disruption? Is it simply the how we replace computers with smartphones, or (for those who remember) how we moved from records to CDs and (briefly) to minidisk? Or how we moved from bookshops to Amazon, or record shops and then internet piracy to Spotify. Isn't it what explains why Kodak went out of business when digital cameras were introduced? And isn't disruption why everyone is now having to go through digital transformation programs and why every company insists on having an app?

These are the surface level foam of disruption. They are what we see and what we talk about. They are often what gets talked about in the press because the fuller story of disruption is much more confusing, less obvious but, to my mind, far more exciting and for more about the humans involved.

Disruption is probably the wrong word to use because it has been co-opted by the tech-bro, capitalist cliche. I have nothing as such against tech-bros or capitalists, but they do tend to use disruption as code for the future, what's good and what should be funded or supported. Again, this is overly simplistic.

But I don't have a better word, so I am going to use disruption but before we get into looking at how we can use music as a lens to understand it, we need to look at different aspects of industry, technological and social disruption. We need to look broadly because the patterns of cause and response are easier to understand with more examples and more ways of looking at the phenomenon.

# The plan for this chapter

In this Chapter, we need to start by looking over one of the canonical examples of disruption: how the music industry was disrupted by the internet. We will pick over the bones of this example over the course of this book, but we need this to set the scene for us.

In order to understand this classic example, we need to bring in the innovator's dilemma - a brilliant way of reading how companies and industries evolve. But we then need to broaden out from this narrow (in a good way) definition because, as I think you'll find if we have a wider frame of reference and relax our definition we can start to see similar things happening throughout history and throughout many industries.

This achieves something which I've come to think of as "seeing and labelling blue". The ancient greeks didn't have a word for blue even though they obviously had a lot of blue above them all the time - the sky. They used many different words to desribe the things that were blue but had no need for the word or concept itself. Only later ((Get the ref when)) was the idea of blue needed and the label created. My use of this is to squint at the world, observing lots of samples, case studies and from many different angles. After a while you start to see patterns. After a while you "see blue".

This can sound utterly wishy washy nonsense. I think it's the opposite. This is how we humans make progress: we squint at the world and realise that what we are looking at looks like something we've looked at before. We roll the ideas, the form and the behaviour around in our mind creating a mental model of this thing, whatever it is. At some point, either quickly or after years or even many generations we give it a label which means it's a concept we talk about.

My view is that we talk about some aspects of industry, company and social/economic disruption but we haven't yet built up the intuitions for how a lot of change comes about. We often seem confused or upset that things aren't like they used to be, even though this not-like-used-to-be-ness is exactly what the world should be doing all the time.

So we start by playing with examples to get our mind in gear. The first examples are all on the disruption-heavy side - the tech-bro, capitalist, everything-must-change-now side. These are valid but they are biased so we then temper the argument by showing what _doesn't_ change in an attempt to protect us from succoming to the idea that everything is changing, everything is going to be disrupted all the time and there is no stability. There _is_ stability, often caused by slower rates of change which provide a kind of stability.

Seeing disruption in the world from many different angles and then tempering this potentially franetic view of the world with a bit of stability should, I hope, give a picture of the kinds of phenomena that we are trying to understand. From this selection of samples, observations, ((there's a term - something from geology??)) we should have a sense of the things we want to get to grips with. 

All of this will, I hope, give us the sense of the kinds of things we should have a feel for. It should feel like we've just stepped on a boat and started to feel the way that it moves. If I describe the way the boat tips or the way it bounces over the waves, you know what I'm referring to. If I talk about the jolt as the boat turns (or "tacks" in the sailing jargon), you know the force you feel as you're pulled towards or away from your seat on the boat.

As we move into the last section of this chapter, we should have a shared idea of the things in disruption we're looking for. Some examples - We want to understand why one technology replaces another and why it looks like it'll never happen until it's obvious why it did. We want to understand how a new wave or new use of technology changes how we see certain human activities - computers made manual arithmetic a less important workplace skill; what might AI generated content do to workplace skills? The purpose of human activity changes, but why and how?

We will also be trying to understand why the thing that wins doesn't seem to have all the possible features or complexity that it could. Why can a change in the flow ((hasn't been explained)) of value change more than just that flow - why and how are their knock-on effects? How come things have economic value and then they don't? Or they don't have economic value and then they do? What can we or should we be measuring anyway?

We will end this chapter with our plan for using music as a lens for understanding disruption in the world.

# **What follows are section outlines for the rest of this chapter**

# Music Industry, Napster and Spotify.

**#NEXT write the rest of the outline so it's understandable.**
**Do a bit of research for each - don't need lots though**


Around the turn of the century, the revenue of the music industry was being eaten by services like Napster and Pirate Bay. 
The industry didn't really win though - the incomes of lots of musicians has been destroyed. Spotify, the dominant global player in music does not necessarily act in the best interests of the musicians and music industry, but it did win. This pattern plays out again and again; a shift from one industry and one set of interests, to another industry and another set of interests.


# The innovator's dilemma

Introduce the idea here.

This is talked about a lot, but most writing about this is either academic or quite theoretical. In fact, being practical about the innovator's dilemma is extremely hard.


# The key question

Here's a question: Why was the music industry disrupted?

What alternatives could have played out and who would have been responsible for those?

This is either a very simple question or very complex. It's usually answered by saying that a disruptive technology came along (except tapes disrupted CDs, which disrupted records - so that doesn't quite cut it). Or that the industry had an entrenched model (except it was used to making music free on radio in return for royalties, so that doesn't quite add up either). **Get a few more examples**.

As you dig into why an industry is disrupted you go through layers and layers of market and human behaviour. Entrenched business models, lack of awareness of new ways of doing things, people identifying with the craft instead of the outcome, lack of access to new kinds of customers. So on, down and down.


# Non-music examples of disruption

*Boats & Roads*
(Kinsale)

*Amazon and publishers.*
(Look up the various legal cases)

*Mining.*
Various generations of mining.

*Banking, Challenger banks & Crypto // sending money*
[Get Bank 4.0. Interview the author.]

Crypto. Start with the promise of disruption. It requires imaginging new flows of value - new ways of doing things. It also requires building those ways and all the machinery and culture around it.

_But_, the banking system still controls the flow of value. the value isn't purely money - it's also trust.

Progression of sending money
Barter
Gold
Tablets / tokens
East India company - way of doing transactions on paper (which 'disrupts' the need for movement of hard cash)
PayPal
Crypto

These 1-dimensional timelines can be unsatisfactory. Perhaps each new method / innovation is sequential but not a straight improvment - it's more about trade offs.


*Smartphone vs laptop/desktops*
Apple created a new place for new value. 

Use the picture of all the things which ended upon on the smartphone. 

*Slave trade*
Trading of slaves obviously disrupted, in an horrific way, the lives of millions of people. It happened because the enslavers realised they could capture value in one place and get new value for it elsewhere, a practice in trade called arbitrage; buy it cheap in one place in order to sell it for more elsewhere.

*Disruption and evolution of information / communication*
(This is not broadcast communication - this is 2-way / discussion etc)
Travelling
Letters / postal service
Telegraph
Landline phone
Mobile phone
Computer - fixed internet
Smartphone

How do we measure the "improvements"? Cost, speed, density of information / bandwidth, network size.

Measuring improvements quickly leads to the intuition that each wave of disruption is not necessarily an improvement. We know this because we have in person meetings when we need to convey more but email when the information is (perhaps) more routine. 

*AI's impact*

(Find someone else's timeline of this)

Abacus
Clockwork
...
Value
Mainframes
Programming (expert systems)
Narrow AI
...
General AI

Again, how do we measure the improvement in calculation?
GFLOPS
£s/GFLOPS
(£s/GFLOPS) / average page (to give a sense of how much cheaper than a human the computer system is?)

Or do we measure the impact on the things it replaces? E.g. we don't have typing pools anymore.

*Layers of information platforms/broadcast media*
Theatre
Email lists
Blogs
Social - sub-groups
YouTube
TikTok

As we see progression of the information platforms, we see that new nuances are important. TikTok is, in effect the same as YouTube but the arrangement of the information within the medium (video on mobile device) brings new nuances. These naunces are easy to ignore if you're being disrupted - it all looks like same: video on you own website, on Vimeo, on YouTube, or TikTok is all video. Except that the progression introduces nuance.

*Education*

Community
(Get a bit of history on this)
Industrial
..
DuoLingo

The purpose of education. This means that the important value the world finds in education shifts. What we see in education (like a lot of slower moving industries) is a dogma which persists long after the shift in underlying desired value has happened. People want something new from education but education (the industry) doesn't understand what this is.

Education is also subject to non-disruptable limits: the key point of education is to alter the brains of humans. If there are physical/biological limits to this, those will dictate the possible rate of change.

*Shipping / trade*
Changes in trade routes - as new value is discovered. 

In a way, shipping might be a better way of viewing disruption because it's physical. For our purposes, we can see all human endevour as some form of arbitrage and creation - finding value in one place, adding something to it and selling it for more value elsewhere.

*Companies which have been disrupted*

_Look into each of these_

Pan Am
Borders
Pets.com
Tower Records
General motors
Kodak


*High street*

Travel agents (vs AirBnB)
High st shops (get stats on the shift and see how much is / has really shifted. Also get Ben Evan's numbers on how much online has really eaten vs creating.)


*Other forms of disruption - Covid*

These forms of disruption change the flow of value

Increased time online
massive decrease in foot fall. Thisis very easy to visualise but it's a direct example of "flows of value" <-- i need to introduce this idea without using that phrase too early.





## Future:

AI content creation - writing, art. (There will also be music.)
This questions what it means to be a human, but that question is directly related to questions like "what does it mean to listen to music". 


Driverless cars

Drone delivery



## Temper the argument

Things that can't be disrupted or don't create new, long 

Tullips - no real long term value
The frozen water trade - wasted effort
Gamestop = no underlying value
Education = the hardest part of education is the human brain


Disruption does not always mean reducing overall value.
E.g. Uber - more cabs after it was introduced.
Music - (get a stat on this). More music is listened to now.


Disruption doesn't always mean better things for everyone. We have grown expert at arbitrage with positive outcomes for one set of people but very negative outcomes for others. Cheap clothes, technology, energy all have impacts on other people.


Also, it's not true that everything is changing faster than ever. [Get some data for this]. Some things are changing rapidly when viewed from a certain light: the changes in how people consume content are changing almost by the week, with content/social platforms becoming every more expert in keeping our attention. However, the way I fix the pointing (that's the cement between the bricks) on the front of my house is pretty much what it would have been 100 years ago when the house was built, or 500 or 1000 years ago.

There are strata of change. The top layer changes rapidly, the lower layers change slowly.

Old vs new value. New value is not necessarily better or worse than old. A lot of time is spent by incumbents explaining why we need to protect our institutions or by disruptors explaining that we need to embrace the future. I am firmly in neither camp. 


New / disruptive value doesn't mean that fundamental good business practice disappears. The Dot Com boom, which saw valuations detacted from reality or the Tullip mania [of the XXXX century] show that we lose track of reality. We are in a closed system - finite resources, finite time and a biological need to eat, socialise and provide for ourselves. This means that, while you can borrow from the future you do have to pay it back.



# Using Music as a lens

Throughout this book, we will see examples from many industries but with each phenomenon, music will be our starting point.

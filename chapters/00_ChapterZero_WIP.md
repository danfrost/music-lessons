# Chapter Zero

_This draft is for feedback - I just need coherent words and some good examples to show that this disruption thing happens again and again._

Plan:
1. Music example of disruption (briefly)
2. Non-music examlpes of disruption
3. Temper the argument - not everything has changed, but sometimes it does
4. We can use music as a lens because what we see in the arguments for/against disruption of this industry and what we see in the human and market behaviours (I think) applies to many other industries.

What is industry disruption? Is it simply the how we replace computers with smartphones, or (for those who remember) how we moved from records to CDs and (briefly) to minidisk? Or how we moved from bookshops to Amazon, or record shops and then internet piracy to Spotify. Isn't it what explains why Kodak went out of business when digital cameras were introduced? And isn't disruption why everyone is now having to go through digital transformation programs and why every company insists on having an app?

These are the surface level foam of disruption. They are what we see and what we talk about. They are often what gets talked about in the press because the fuller story of disruption is much more confusing, less obvious but, to my mind, far more exciting and for more about the humans involved.

Disruption is probably the wrong word to use because it has been co-opted by the tech-bro, capitalist cliche. I have nothing as such against tech-bros or capitalists, but they do tend to use disruption as code for the future, what's good and what should be funded or supported. Again, this is overly simplistic.

But I don't have a better word, so I am going to use disruption but before we get into looking at how we can use music as a lens to understand it, we need to look at different aspects of industry, technological and social disruption. We need to look broadly because the patterns of cause and response are easier to understand with more examples and more ways of looking at the phenomenon.

## The plan for this chapter

In this Chapter, we need to start by looking over one of the canonical examples of disruption: how the music industry was disrupted by the internet. We will pick over the bones of this example over the course of this book, but we need this to set the scene for us.

In order to understand this classic example, we need to bring in the innovator's dilemma - a brilliant way of reading how companies and industries evolve. But we then need to broaden out from this narrow (in a good way) definition because, as I think you'll find if we have a wider frame of reference and relax our definition we can start to see similar things happening throughout history and throughout many industries.

This achieves something which I've come to think of as "seeing and labelling blue". The ancient greeks didn't have a word for blue even though they obviously had a lot of blue above them all the time - the sky. They used many different words to desribe the things that were blue but had no need for the word or concept itself. Only later ((Get the ref when)) was the idea of blue needed and the label created. My use of this is to squint at the world, observing lots of samples, case studies and from many different angles. After a while you start to see patterns. After a while you "see blue".

This can sound utterly wishy washy nonsense. I think it's the opposite. This is how we humans make progress: we squint at the world and realise that what we are looking at looks like something we've looked at before. We roll the ideas, the form and the behaviour around in our mind creating a mental model of this thing, whatever it is. At some point, either quickly or after years or even many generations we give it a label which means it's a concept we talk about.

My view is that we talk about some aspects of industry, company and social/economic disruption but we haven't yet built up the intuitions for how a lot of change comes about. We often seem confused or upset that things aren't like they used to be, even though this not-like-used-to-be-ness is exactly what the world should be doing all the time.

So we start by playing with examples to get our mind in gear. The first examples are all on the disruption-heavy side - the tech-bro, capitalist, everything-must-change-now side. These are valid but they are biased so we then temper the argument by showing what _doesn't_ change in an attempt to protect us from succoming to the idea that everything is changing, everything is going to be disrupted all the time and there is no stability. There _is_ stability, often caused by slower rates of change which provide a kind of stability.

Seeing disruption in the world from many different angles and then tempering this potentially franetic view of the world with a bit of stability should, I hope, give a picture of the kinds of phenomena that we are trying to understand. From this selection of samples, observations, ((there's a term - something from geology??)) we should have a sense of the things we want to get to grips with. 

All of this will, I hope, give us the sense of the kinds of things we should have a feel for. It should feel like we've just stepped on a boat and started to feel the way that it moves. If I describe the way the boat tips or the way it bounces over the waves, you know what I'm referring to. If I talk about the jolt as the boat turns (or "tacks" in the sailing jargon), you know the force you feel as you're pulled towards or away from your seat on the boat.

As we move into the last section of this chapter, we should have a shared idea of the things in disruption we're looking for. Some examples - We want to understand why one technology replaces another and why it looks like it'll never happen until it's obvious why it did. We want to understand how a new wave or new use of technology changes how we see certain human activities - computers made manual arithmetic a less important workplace skill; what might AI generated content do to workplace skills? The purpose of human activity changes, but why and how?

We will also be trying to understand why the thing that wins doesn't seem to have all the possible features or complexity that it could. Why can a change in the flow ((hasn't been explained)) of value change more than just that flow - why and how are their knock-on effects? How come things have economic value and then they don't? Or they don't have economic value and then they do? What can we or should we be measuring anyway?

We will end this chapter with our plan for using music as a lens for understanding disruption in the world.

## --What follows are section outlines for the rest of this chapter--

**#NEXT write the rest of the outline so it's understandable.**
**Do a bit of research for each - don't need lots though**

## Music Industry, Napster and Spotify.

Around the turn of the century, the revenue of the music industry was being eaten by services like Napster and Pirate Bay. 

The industry didn't really win though - the incomes of lots of musicians have been destroyed. Spotify, the dominant global player in music does not necessarily act in the best interests of the musicians and music industry, but it did win. This pattern plays out again and again; a shift from one industry and one set of interests, to another industry and another set of interests.

## The innovator's dilemma

Introduce the idea here.

This is talked about a lot, but most writing about this is either academic or quite theoretical. In fact, being practical about the innovator's dilemma is extremely hard.

Most of the business leaders I've met haven't read this. 

## The key question

Here's a question: Why was the music industry disrupted?

What alternatives could have played out and who would have been responsible for those?

This is either a very simple question or very complex. It's usually answered by saying that a disruptive technology came along (except tapes disrupted CDs, which disrupted records - so that doesn't quite cut it). Or that the industry had an entrenched model (except it was used to making music free on radio in return for royalties, so that doesn't quite add up either). **Get a few more examples**.

    "Really? Spotify and Netflix pale in comparison to what Napster was. For all the content you think you have access to, Napster gave us the ability to see what other people had stored on their drives, stuff that they wanted to share rather than whatever media Spotify has a license for. That opened a world of discovery unmatched by any streaming service, or all of them put together. Want a club track from an unknown Russian group that only existed for a few nights back in 1998?

As you dig into why an industry is disrupted you go through layers and layers of market and human behaviour. Entrenched business models, lack of awareness of new ways of doing things, people identifying with the craft instead of the outcome, lack of access to new kinds of customers. So on, down and down.


## Non-music examples of disruption

==start
Mundane
I have spent the past 15 years researching and understanding disruption, initially from the point of view of the music industry (I graduated from my music degree just as Napster screwed with music’s most popular business model) and then broadening out into commodities, machinery and anything else I can find out about.

A couple of years ago, after more than a decade in the same job and in need of clearing my head I went on holiday to the south of Ireland with my wife. We took bags of books with us as we always do, and I took several on innovation, technology and industry. All the usual topics for me.

On this holiday I found the most elegant example of disruption which made what has felt distant, complex and largely about technology suddenly very human, close and about people and their families.

But I didn’t find this in any of the books on innovation and tech that I’d brought.

I found it in a tiny bookshop in a book about a town called Kinsale. Kinsale is a beautiful harbour town with a long maritime history. In this unlikely setting I learnt that disruption is simple and mundane. We overthink disruption, but how to disrupt others and how to defend ourselves.

All the stories of tech startups, new scientific inventions and feature wars don’t compare with the simplicity of disruption which took place in Kinsale. The canonical disruption stories are predicated on new technologies and complex business models which, I find, confuse us from the simplicity of the situation.

In 1665 someone wanted to challenge the existing business models, investments, careers of the Kinsale families with something entirely simple.

As simple as a bridge
View fullsize
1024px-Admiralty_Chart_No_2053_Ireland_south_coast_Kinsale_Harbour_and_Oyster_Haven,_Published_1851.jpg
While bridges facilitate the transport of goods and people, they can be an intrusion and frequently gave rise to conflicts of interest. Innishannon Bridge, 9 miles upriver, was the cloest crossing to Kinsale until the nineteenth century. On 5 May 1665 Kinsale Corporation ‘resolved to oppose the payment of money towards Innishannon Bridge’ as it gave access to territory south of the Bandon, having a detrimental effect on traffic and commerce through Kinsale. Shipping interests in Kinsale and Bandon argues that bridges interfered with movement on the river. Added to this, it was argued that the necessary infrastructure, roads and access would be a levy on the rates. 

Kinsale Harbour, A History. John Thuillier.

When your interests are shipping, disruption is as simple as a bridge. If we focus too much on our present technology, we miss the idea that our troubles, confusions and disruptions are just one example. This has happened many times, for hundreds of years.

The beautiful image this conjured for me was of the Kinsale Corporation wracking their brains with these damned bridges. Why should people need more of them? What’s the point? Surely we are a boating people and we have boating interests to consider. We are people who sail. This is who we are and we have built up generations of knowledge, skills, equipment and culture around being in boats. Why bother with these bridges? There is no benefit and in fact there is a considerable potential loss.

You can imagine the discussions in the pubs and on the boats. Families anxiety of their future. Will their sons and daughters have the life that their parents had? Will their friends and society carry on?

Perhaps I’d sending this up somewhat, but this simple, mundane example is how disruption is normally felt. It’s choosing to block the new bridge instead of fund it. Choosing to use your existing skills and tools rather than retrain and shift your economy. 

The social and emotional part of disruption is what makes disruption so hard to deal with. If organisations were totally dispassionate and made up of people who were ready to retrain at a moment’s notice while dropping all sense of professional (and perhaps cultural) identity, this would surely not be a problem. The organisation would recognise the need to change the business and everybody would teach themselves the new thing. Within days or perhaps a few weeks or months, the business, the society and families would be reinvented.

But that isn’t what happens*.

(*Netflix provides not so much an exception as an example of why this is true. I’ll write about that in future.)

When “we are” kicks in
What usually happens in response to a disruptive threat is that people first see it in terms of what they are not. Building on years of professional and social identity, they create an idea of what they are and the many things that they are not. They will also look at suppliers, partners and customers as what the are and what they are not. And what they want and what doesn’t matter.

They turn an implicit, unspoken idea of their market into a cultural reality. This did exist before but, like all situations when we are presented with a foe, our sense of identity is heightened.

Already the idea of “we are” kicks in.

We are not an electricity company. Or a shipping company. Or an internet company. That is not our culture, our background, our skills.

We are a fishing company. We are not a bridge company.

This is perhaps where the death of the firm, industries and careers start: by too strongly associating with the activity and output rather than the underlying value. There is fundamentally no difference in the outcome value of moving things by river than by road, but there are many skill, professional and cultural values which build up in the activity of each. That one activity is more or less economical than the other is not a judgement on its value, even when disruption takes place. But as soon as you identify yourself as “a boating people”, the argument is much less pragmatic.

Disruption pits methods and cultures against each other based on economics. Disruption makes it feel like everybody is being judged. The winners are right, the losers are wrong. But the winners and losers also build cultures around their activity. And so disruption feels like its judging your sense of self.

Disruption kicks in
The misplaced sense of identity creates premature rigour mortis. Before the firm is actually dead, a paralysis of decision making, skills and capabilities causes it to narrow the scope of what it’s comfortable doing. It outsources the new because this is not its “core competency” while the emerging competition build the competencies which become critical. It looks at its past for guidance, while the emerging competition have no past and look only to the future, and  - crucially - tend to look only at the customers rather than “what we know”.

We see all of this in the past 20 years of digital disruption, but we see it also in the Kinsale bridge story. Organisations built around the idea of boats lock arms in opposition to the idea of bridges. Disruption is complex, technical and yet oh so very mundane.

It’s almost poetic to think of the decimation of industries and the confusion caused as something as simple as moving from a boat to a bridge. But, I believe that’s exactly what the Kinsail story tells us. In 400 years time, the confusion, disruption and decimation of industries and jobs will appear as simple as a shift from a boat to a bridge.

Over-thinking it / under-thinking it
All of this is interesting, but what models and ideas can we extract from it to help us think?

We under-think mundane threats. For too many organisations, their “web presence” is there because everyone else is doing it. So is their social media presence. They have a data lake because Gartner said they should. They hire more UX because someone else is doing this. In short, the organisations have no real leadership, they have leaders which follow and do leadership by checklists.

This is what results in Clay Christianson’s “good managers doing the right thing” (which ends up in being disrupted), but there may be a nuance to dig in to.

If you are a boating company and someone else is building bridges, whose interest do you think about? If it is that of the firm and the shareholders, does that make sense? Does it really matter how the firm, as you have it pictured in your mind, survives? Do the shareholders care that their return comes from pieces of wood in the water instead of pieces of stone in the air?

I believe this is an emotional and identity problem, not a technology or skills one.

Threats start as toys or apparent distractions. At this stage we under-think how we’re going to address it. “Nobody buys a book or clothes or dog food on the internet - I have a report which says so” was, in 2001, a totally professional, completely normal and absolutely wrong way of thinking. We don’t engage properly with the things we don’t understand and we don’t understand things at their early stages.

And then. Time passes.

And then. Things change.

And it turns out that while you were operating on the certainty of your report and your incumbent understanding, the new competitors were evolving what is true and what it fundamental. They both saw the future and weren’t distracted by the past. Either way, they see what the new truth is.

Suddenly, perhaps over years or decades the truth of society and technology changes. This is because there is absolutely no fundamental truth of society and technology. There is only what we build. And if you were distracted by building what was true in your industry 10 years ago, … well. We know.

We under-think our short term reaction to apparently mundane threats. And we over-think our historical strength and its relevance to respond to them.

We over-think our long term reaction to mundane threats. We think that we need piles of cash, a complete reorganisation and stacks of new strategy, when the cause of these threats is operating on a shoe string budget by a bunch of students in a garage. The actual work required to respond to a threat (not the organisational and inward-looking work, but the concrete build of a new product or feature) is often extremely mundane.

Boats and carts
Migrating an organisation (or an industry or a country) from doing one thing to another is simply retraining some humans and doing a different thing. There may also be some equipment involved, perhaps some legal things and some new suppliers. Nothing in that process is insurmountable.

The boaters of Kinsail could have been comfortable with the change if they had just thought: fine… we will either add carts to our business or move entirely to carts. That’s not a big thing.

But before the rational thought comes the emotional and highly identity-based thought. “We are a boating family. We have been for generations.” And we are back to reaction to the event, not reaction to the trend.

Follow the flow of value
Beyond the effect of the thread of disruption, this charmingly simple story also teaches us to think about the flow of value and perhaps this is a way of thinking about disruption and layers of innovation. Before the bridges were even thought of, the value flowed through the routes of the boats. The roads and the boating routes defined where any ancillary value could be captured: inns and pubs, boat yards, light houses etc. All of these are on the route of value.

Grasping the idea of “routes of value” is easy because we can see it. It’s still true of physical shops: the higher the foot fall (the route of value) the higher the rents but also the higher the return. The further away from the route of value, the lower prices and the harder it is to earn.

When the idea of the bridge is presented (before they are built) the route of value is suddenly questioned in a way that it wasn’t before. Are the boating routes that valuable? Clearly they are for the livelihoods of the boating families, but are they worth defending?

Similarly, as we’ve seen this year (2020) more than ever, the route of value is not necessarily the high street. It is through little rectangles. That’s a physical reality - we have to accept this before we look at the economic of cultural shifts which might happen and how to react to them.

The same thing happened when the internet made everyone realise that the value in bookshops, record stores, CD sales and more were perhaps not as axiomatic as it seemed. The internet built bridges between creators and consumers in ways which bypassed the old institutions. The internet didn’t do anything bad as such, it just reframed where the value lies.

Which leads to a constructive set of questions: how can you identify the flows of values which you think are axiomatic and will never change? How can you explore where new flows of value might be occur? And what will they do to your involvement in the value?

Practically speaking, there are no other questions to answer. Everything else is noise.

Unfortunately, almost no leaders I have seen have this insight. They describe their own routes of value. They describe their boats.

Oh - and the bridges were built. So prepare for the bridges to be built in your world. Even if you are the incumbent. Even if you feel like your “value” (however you define it) should be protected, history shows that value shifts.

*Mining.*
Various generations of mining.

TASK: Research this - is this from the Innovator's dilemma?

*Banking, Challenger banks & Crypto // sending money*

If we think about the history and disruption of banking and money, it's easy to see the shift from barter to money to banks to online banking and then crypto. Basically, to look just at money as a way of buying things in the momeny. Money is more complex than this though - it's a store of value, it has a future value, its value depends on what's going on in the economy, and there are different types of money - central banks, commercial banks, consumer, cash etc.

Money is a particularly interesting one when it comes to the flow of value.

If we compare one form of money to another, we can see different available flows of value to different people. In the beginning there was no money and there wasn't even barter. You forrage or hunt for food and you have the value you need. There is no storage, no future value. If we barter then value from my activity has found its way into your life - there are overlapping flows of value in our activity. (This is like a cross-roads or X shape.)

When I learn to preserve food, I prolong the value of my activity into the future.

If we introduce a coin or token of some kind, we enable flows of value which are not only geographical but through time. We have created a network of possible trade.

If you make a bank, and I deposit my cash in your bank to withdraw in the future we have done multiple things: my accumulated money becomes more useful to me because I don't have to look after it; I don't need to have a safe or other storage. But you can now lend that. Yet more flows of value.

However, you have become a gatekeeper to whoever can borrow from you. While we have created flows of value we have not made these flows available to everyone. 

This is illustrated in the case of the East India company when they created a system to take deposits in [find out where] and allow withdrawls [find out where]. This does two things: it solves a problem that the East India company had in getting money from X to Y but it also, by design, it excludes a lot of people from (legitimate and illegitimal) access to that money. Their system wasn't designed or built to allow just anyone to move money from X to Y, it was designed as a very specific flow of very specific value for very specific people.

A lot of money systems are exactly this way. They allow a very specific form of value to be stored/exchanged between very specific entities. It's not true that each progression from one technology to another is an improvement of everything, nor is it a (dis?!)improvement. So what happens?

These 1-dimensional timelines can be unsatisfactory. Perhaps each new method / innovation is sequential but not a straight improvment - it's more about trade offs. And not just in the technology itself but in where the technology can be applied. 


This tells us that the progression from one technology to another is not

Crypto. Start with the promise of disruption. It requires imaginging new flows of value - new ways of doing things. It also requires building those ways and all the machinery and culture around it.

_But_, the banking system still controls the flow of value. the value isn't purely money - it's also trust.

*Slave trade*
Trading of slaves obviously disrupted, in an horrific way, the lives of millions of people. It happened because the enslavers realised they could capture value in one place and get new value for it elsewhere, a practice in trade called arbitrage; buy it cheap in one place in order to sell it for more elsewhere.

How do we measure the "improvements"? Cost, speed, density of information / bandwidth, network size.

Measuring improvements quickly leads to the intuition that each wave of disruption is not necessarily an improvement. We know this because we have in person meetings when we need to convey more but email when the information is (perhaps) more routine. 

*Smartphone vs laptop/desktops*
In the previous example, we looked at a series of technologies under the heading of "communication" technology but this undersells the impact they had. Landline phones didn't just allow communication between people, it allowed trading of stocks around the world - or maybe it was the telegraph which enabled that. Either way, the communication technology allowed the communication of very different types of messages which have very different types of value. Phoning your uncle in another country to talk about your visit has a very different impact to spending 4 hours on a transatlantic call to negotiate buying a company.

The shift from desktops/laptops to smartphone did exactly this. The smartphone didn't just absorb the value that landline phones previously held, but myriad other things. Music, photography, socialising, film, banking and many other things.

The interesting thing is that this value was finally, after a few false starts put into the marketplace by Apple. The false starts [...General Magic...].

The important observation here is the shift in Apple's own value from computers to smartphones, and the many layers of value which were built on top of that.

They were able to create their own value. 

This is a story which has been picked apart a million times and I don't think analysing this is going to bring new insight. What we need to ask was, what way of seeing the world did they have which allowed them to move so confidently into an area that they had tried and failed in before? (The smartphone was basically a PDA, which the Newton was but that failed.)

The easy thing to do here is to look at what people at Apple did to create the iPhone. This is what a lot of business books do - they give you case studies in how the people who did the thing did the thing. That's perfectly useful and you should read those books, but that's not what we're going to do here. I don't think that's a particularly useful exercise because you end up cargo culting [introduce the idea here or earlier on - maybe in the intro with all the silly things that organisations do]. What we need to ask is: what were the deeper ideas or motivations which allowed Apple to detact itself from being in the business of building desktop computers and allowed it to build a new generation of computing?

In order to answer a question like this, case studies won't entirely answer the question because each case study is a sample of what happened. It's an example of one set of humans in one circumstance who reacted in one partciular way. If you know any amount of statistics you know that one measurement is not data - annecdote is not the same as data.

My contention is that to learn about how Apple pivoted from one technology to another we need to look at how other pivots have happened - in this book we will us music and explore how pivots from one instrument to another, from one musical system to another, from one form of music to another. 

What underlies this is a believe that the creativity of the human brain is working in the same way across many domains.

AI is the 4th revolution:
Steam power (1784)
Electricity (1870)
IT (1969)
AI (today)

This is another series of technology progressions which are known about but not really understood. ((Perhaps move this to near the top of this chapter. Reference The Lunar Men)).

Books:
    the measure of all minds - relevant for: how we measure as technology changes (in this case from the human brain to machines)

    Artificial Intelligence - an illustrated history. Clifford A Pickover.


Rather than think about the history of artificial intelligence as machines like HAL or deep neural networks, it's more useful to think about the rise of things which take decision making away from humans. This is a thread of technology progression which makes more sense.

We hvae built tools to help us think and to help us make decisions for a long time. THe abacus and [get other] counting machines augment the human's ability to make a decision about how much of something there is, or how that thing could be shared between multiple parties. It also serves a purpose of communicating the working - I can put the beads in a particular position and then you could take over from me. It's a form of ancient spreadsheet in that way.

Scales also take subjective weight decisions and make them objective. Clockwork divides time, but also makes possible other processes which can be mechanised and regularised. 

Each of these is not traditionally a form of artificial intelligence, but I think starting with these makes more recent AI feel like just another way of taking what humans do and automating or mechanising it.

As we progress to electronics, the value made possible a very specific piece of human behaviour which enabled a gigantic world of possibilities. By focusing on switches - turning electric current on and off, values were able to be turned into machines which could count.

Binary calculations persisted as computing power increased, but the underlying technology shifted from values to solid state electronics. We have lived through this revolution and we have felt the effects, but it's worth spending time reflecting on the impact. The tiny world of binary calculations has led to almost every industry's communication being rebuilt on top of something electronic. Like the telephone enabling completely new flows of value, electronics changes _where_ the work was done which changes availabel flows of value.

We then follow this artificial intelligence / automation / mechanisation of the human capabilities through mainframes, increased computing power, larger networks through to AI. If you know anything about any of these you'll know I have conflated a human number of somewhat-related areas very simplistically. This is deliberate. The underlying technologies of computing, communication and AI are not the effect, they are the cause.

..

How are we measuring the progress of computing? One way is to talk about the number of calculations which can be performed each second. ((Add a chart)) This reduces life down to just that - calculations. This is interesting, but is merely a proxy for the impact of computing. What about how computers compete with humans on difficult tasks? This is interesting because it gives us a sense of how this new creature of AI-enabled-computing compares to us, and it seems a very human thing to do to judge something new in terms of what we know.

Those are all 1st-order effects. A 1st order effect is what happens as a result of an action. I push the first domino over and it falls over; I push the glass over and the glass falls over. 1st order effects in technology are the remit of the engineer, but they don't really help us think about how the world as a whole will change.

More intersting are the 2nd and 3rd order effects. In truth, thinking beyond this is a series of "if this... and if that... and if the other thing... then X will be true" statements. We string together endless possibilities and only some are going to happen. But it is those 2nd, 3rd... nth order effects which is what makes the real difference.

The internet enabled communication of arbitrary information at global scale. That's the 1st order effect. The nth order effect is that governments were able to interfere in elections by manipulating how society communicated on new platforms built on top of the internet; and that I can commission work on research, production and promotion with a team around the world without meeting any of them or worrying about physical contracts.

Computing is the most obvious case of industry disruption and we could fill a book with endless examples. however, there's no point restating at length the world we live in. What's interesting is to think about what areas of life are about to be eaten by computing and AI. Will it be everything or just a few areas? When an area is replaced with computing and AI, what will the 2nd and 3rd order effects be.

As we enter an ago of content generation, where machines can create content which was previously the role of humans we will see a series of nth-order effects but all we have now are questions: what happens when machines can generate infintie amounts of good quality music? What happens when machines can both generate music and measure of heart-rate / brain activity to calm you? What happens when machines can summarise statistics better than humans (which they can already do)? A lot of this capability is here already, we just haven't seen the effects.

If we go back to two much older technologies, the mechanical clock and the train, we can see an interesting series of nth order impacts. Trained needed train timetables, so clocks became more widespread. This meant that time became more centrally managed - anything related to the trains had to abide by the timing of the trains.

((Find some research on this - some case studies e.g. of how towns changed to have clocks in the middle.))

What are the equivalents going to be in AI? Maybe that's not the right question - that's asking for a specific set of predictions. Maybe we need to think about how to breakdown the problem, so the question becomes: how can we think about the impact of new forms of AI (without endlessly speculating what the specific impacts will be)?

Again, how do we measure the improvement in calculation?
GFLOPS
£s/GFLOPS
(£s/GFLOPS) / average page (to give a sense of how much cheaper than a human the computer system is?)

XXREMOVE Or do we measure the impact on the things it replaces? E.g. we don't have typing pools anymore.

*Layers of information platforms/broadcast media*


Theatre
Email lists
Blogs
Social - sub-groups
YouTube
TikTok

As we see progression of the information platforms, we see that new nuances are important. TikTok is, in effect the same as YouTube but the arrangement of the information within the medium (video on mobile device) brings new nuances. These naunces are easy to ignore if you're being disrupted - it all looks like same: video on you own website, on Vimeo, on YouTube, or TikTok is all video. Except that the progression introduces nuance.

*Education*

Community
(Get a bit of history on this)
Industrial
..
DuoLingo

The purpose of education. This means that the important value the world finds in education shifts. What we see in education (like a lot of slower moving industries) is a dogma which persists long after the shift in underlying desired value has happened. People want something new from education but education (the industry) doesn't understand what this is.

Education is also subject to non-disruptable limits: the key point of education is to alter the brains of humans. If there are physical/biological limits to this, those will dictate the possible rate of change.

*Shipping / trade*
Changes in trade routes - as new value is discovered. 

In a way, shipping might be a better way of viewing disruption because it's physical. For our purposes, we can see all human endevour as some form of arbitrage and creation - finding value in one place, adding something to it and selling it for more value elsewhere.

*Companies which have been disrupted*

_Look into each of these_

Pan Am
Borders
Pets.com
Tower Records
General motors
Kodak


*High street*

Travel agents (vs AirBnB)
High st shops (get stats on the shift and see how much is / has really shifted. Also get Ben Evan's numbers on how much online has really eaten vs creating.)


*Other forms of disruption - Covid*

These forms of disruption change the flow of value

Increased time online
massive decrease in foot fall. Thisis very easy to visualise but it's a direct example of "flows of value" <-- i need to introduce this idea without using that phrase too early.





## Future:

AI content creation - writing, art. (There will also be music.)
This questions what it means to be a human, but that question is directly related to questions like "what does it mean to listen to music". 


Driverless cars

Drone delivery



## Temper the argument

Things that can't be disrupted or don't create new, long 

Tullips - no real long term value
The frozen water trade - wasted effort
Gamestop = no underlying value
Education = the hardest part of education is the human brain


Disruption does not always mean reducing overall value.
E.g. Uber - more cabs after it was introduced.
Music - (get a stat on this). More music is listened to now.


Disruption doesn't always mean better things for everyone. We have grown expert at arbitrage with positive outcomes for one set of people but very negative outcomes for others. Cheap clothes, technology, energy all have impacts on other people.


Also, it's not true that everything is changing faster than ever. [Get some data for this]. Some things are changing rapidly when viewed from a certain light: the changes in how people consume content are changing almost by the week, with content/social platforms becoming every more expert in keeping our attention. However, the way I fix the pointing (that's the cement between the bricks) on the front of my house is pretty much what it would have been 100 years ago when the house was built, or 500 or 1000 years ago.

There are strata of change. The top layer changes rapidly, the lower layers change slowly.

Old vs new value. New value is not necessarily better or worse than old. A lot of time is spent by incumbents explaining why we need to protect our institutions or by disruptors explaining that we need to embrace the future. I am firmly in neither camp. 


New / disruptive value doesn't mean that fundamental good business practice disappears. The Dot Com boom, which saw valuations detacted from reality or the Tullip mania [of the XXXX century] show that we lose track of reality. We are in a closed system - finite resources, finite time and a biological need to eat, socialise and provide for ourselves. This means that, while you can borrow from the future you do have to pay it back.



## Using Music as a lens

Throughout this book, we will see examples from many industries but with each phenomenon, music will be our starting point.

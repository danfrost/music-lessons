# Chapter Zero

_This draft is for feedback - I just need coherent words and some good examples to show that this disruption thing happens again and again._

Plan:
1. Music example of disruption (briefly)

2. Non-music examlpes of disruption

3. Temper the argument - not everything has changed, but sometimes it does

4. We can use music as a lens because what we see in the arguments for/against disruption of this industry and what we see in the human and market behaviours (I think) applies to many other industries.

What is industry disruption? Is it simply the how we replace computers with smartphones, or (for those who remember) how we moved from records to CDs and (briefly) to minidisk? Or how we moved from bookshops to Amazon, or record shops and then internet piracy to Spotify. Isn't it what explains why Kodak went out of business when digital cameras were introduced? And isn't disruption why everyone is now having to go through digital transformation programs and why every company insists on having an app?

These are the surface level foam of disruption. They are what we see and what we talk about. They are often what gets talked about in the press because the fuller story of disruption is much more confusing, less obvious but, to my mind, far more exciting and for more about the humans involved.

Disruption is probably the wrong word to use because it has been co-opted by the tech-bro, capitalist cliche. I have nothing as such against tech-bros or capitalists, but they do tend to use disruption as code for the future, what's good and what should be funded or supported. Again, this is overly simplistic.

But I don't have a better word, so I am going to use disruption but before we get into looking at how we can use music as a lens to understand it, we need to look at different aspects of industry, technological and social disruption. We need to look broadly because the patterns of cause and response are easier to understand with more examples and more ways of looking at the phenomenon.

## The plan for this chapter

In this Chapter, we need to start by looking over one of the canonical examples of disruption: how the music industry was disrupted by the internet. We will pick over the bones of this example over the course of this book, but we need this to set the scene for us.

In order to understand this classic example, we need to bring in the innovator's dilemma - a brilliant way of reading how companies and industries evolve. But we then need to broaden out from this narrow (in a good way) definition because, as I think you'll find if we have a wider frame of reference and relax our definition we can start to see similar things happening throughout history and throughout many industries.

This achieves something which I've come to think of as "seeing and labelling blue". The ancient greeks didn't have a word for blue even though they obviously had a lot of blue above them all the time - the sky. They used many different words to desribe the things that were blue but had no need for the word or concept itself. Only later ((Get the ref when)) was the idea of blue needed and the label created. My use of this is to squint at the world, observing lots of samples, case studies and from many different angles. After a while you start to see patterns. After a while you "see blue".

This can sound utterly wishy washy nonsense. I think it's the opposite. This is how we humans make progress: we squint at the world and realise that what we are looking at looks like something we've looked at before. We roll the ideas, the form and the behaviour around in our mind creating a mental model of this thing, whatever it is. At some point, either quickly or after years or even many generations we give it a label which means it's a concept we talk about.

My view is that we talk about some aspects of industry, company and social/economic disruption but we haven't yet built up the intuitions for how a lot of change comes about. We often seem confused or upset that things aren't like they used to be, even though this not-like-used-to-be-ness is exactly what the world should be doing all the time.

So we start by playing with examples to get our mind in gear. The first examples are all on the disruption-heavy side - the tech-bro, capitalist, everything-must-change-now side. These are valid but they are biased so we then temper the argument by showing what _doesn't_ change in an attempt to protect us from succoming to the idea that everything is changing, everything is going to be disrupted all the time and there is no stability. There _is_ stability, often caused by slower rates of change which provide a kind of stability.

Seeing disruption in the world from many different angles and then tempering this potentially franetic view of the world with a bit of stability should, I hope, give a picture of the kinds of phenomena that we are trying to understand. From this selection of samples, observations, ((there's a term - something from geology??)) we should have a sense of the things we want to get to grips with. 

All of this will, I hope, give us the sense of the kinds of things we should have a feel for. It should feel like we've just stepped on a boat and started to feel the way that it moves. If I describe the way the boat tips or the way it bounces over the waves, you know what I'm referring to. If I talk about the jolt as the boat turns (or "tacks" in the sailing jargon), you know the force you feel as you're pulled towards or away from your seat on the boat.

As we move into the last section of this chapter, we should have a shared idea of the things in disruption we're looking for. Some examples - We want to understand why one technology replaces another and why it looks like it'll never happen until it's obvious why it did. We want to understand how a new wave or new use of technology changes how we see certain human activities - computers made manual arithmetic a less important workplace skill; what might AI generated content do to workplace skills? The purpose of human activity changes, but why and how?

We will also be trying to understand why the thing that wins doesn't seem to have all the possible features or complexity that it could. Why can a change in the flow ((hasn't been explained)) of value change more than just that flow - why and how are their knock-on effects? How come things have economic value and then they don't? Or they don't have economic value and then they do? What can we or should we be measuring anyway?

We will end this chapter with our plan for using music as a lens for understanding disruption in the world.

## Music Industry, Napster and Spotify.

Around the turn of the century, the revenue of the music industry was being eaten by services like Napster and Pirate Bay. 

The industry didn't really win though - the incomes of lots of musicians have been destroyed. Spotify, the dominant global player in music does not necessarily act in the best interests of the musicians and music industry, but it did win. This pattern plays out again and again; a shift from one industry and one set of interests, to another industry and another set of interests.

### The innovator's dilemma

A lot of the ideas in this book are either derived or inspired from the Innovator's Dilemma. This is a book which I am constantly surprised hasn't been read more. Almost nobody I work with has read this. Almost no consultants I come across have read more than a summary of it. Many business leaders use the phrase, probably because it is so meaningful as it stands, but they don't know the background case studies or more than one or two fo the key concepts from the book.

This seems utterly baffling to me for two main reasons. Firstly, it's not an overly academic or dense book. It's quite a comfortable read with understandable and jargon-free examples. While it has been criticised for cherry-picking these examples [get ref], so long as we are cognisant of limits of those examples, there's plenty to learn. 

Second, and much more importantly, the lessons from the book describe what industries are going through again and again. This confounds me. This book isn't alone in describing the ludacrous pain organisations go through but it is high up on the listÂ [what??].

I don't remember how or why I discovered this book - probably via a podcast or blog as that's how anything good was found 15 or so years ago. After I did, though, it seems utterly relevant.

// Now explain some of the key concepts.

The chart which sums up the innovator's dilemma is the _increasing value_ chart. There is the literal interpretation of this, which seems very engineering-focused and is about the increasing performance of a particular product. Fast cars. Bigger disk drives. Higher resolution TVs. We're used to the idea that we always want to buy something bigger and better. It's a cheap and easy tech commentator's line of "how far can we take it?". The answer, of course, is not interesting because it depends how far the market (jointly the buyers and sellers) can take it while being economic. I would happily have an infinitely large TV with infinite resolution if it cost me $100, but the suppliers probably wouldn't want to supply that.

No, the increasing performance of a product category is only partly interestig and the innovator's dilemma has a second line on this chart which shows a much more interesting behaviour: The less performance line. While Hifis get ever higher quality, suddenly a file format called mp3 is introduced which is lower quality and, surely, shouldn't be attractive to consumers. Yet it is.

Whe this lower quality, scrappy new entrant comes in all of the suppliers in the high performance category ignore it. It's cheap, pathetic and their customers don't want it. In that moment a wonderful thing happens; the world changes. Suddenly, the certainty over what the future was changes from obvious to contentious. The market is divided.

Except that this moment is not always quick. It can last years or decades. Kodak knew about digital cameras before the world did, but stubournly decided the future was higher quality film with chemicals to print the photographs.

This moment of denial is, where an incumbents digs their heals in and says "no, we know how this works", is one of the key points which sparked my interest in disruption. And it's the moment which I still find coming up again and again.

For me, that graph of increasingly high end quality and challenger, up-start low quality encapsulates so many wrong decisions in so many companies in so many industries. A complete failure to think that your view of the world might be limited and possibly not useful. A failure to see that your idea of value might not apply. A dismissal of other world-views of people who are younger, less explerienced or just different. It happens again and again - the old guard, highly experienced pass judgement on something new using the values and frameworks they have created. 

And at the same time they are digging their heals in, telling everyone around them how right they are are _you need to listen because I've seen this before_ something else magical happens: the up-starts aren't taking part in the conversation. They are just building something. In fact, they don't even think the conversation is a conversation because it sounds suspciously like they are just being told off or told they are wrong. If they, the up-starts, have the tools, wherewithall and the access to customers to build, ship and test something new then the entire conversation - no matter how based in historical fact and real, empirical experience - is utterly irrelevant.

Bitching and moaning that the future is not like the past is cathartic but pointless. After a certain point it's also damaging. It's going to keep people in jobs they shouldn't be in. It's going to prevent industries from changing when they should change. It's also going to 

That's what I read into that chart.

However. What I didn't read was that everything should always be immediately thrown out. As we'll get into, there's an interesting thing in disruption of industries where you have to ask: what, exactly, is being disrupted? Is it the core value of the product (i.e. the old product is irrelevant)? Or is it some aspect, such as the channel to customers. If the thing being disrupted is the channel to customers something interesting happens; the disruptors end up rebuilding themselves in the image of their disruptees.

The big music disruptors have ended up with huge teams of lawers. The education disruptors have ended up employing large teams of teachers and educators. [CHECK these] Even the transport disruptors end up employing people from the old work [CHECK].

This is confusing. The chart told us that the new, up-start thing won over the long run but how come the winners end up employing the loser's employees? Isn't a company just a bunch of employees? Why didn't the old company just do something different?

And now we get to the nub of the point:

Why didn't they just do something different?

_TASK: MORE NEEDED HERE_

This is talked about a lot, but most writing about this is either academic or quite theoretical. In fact, being practical about the innovator's dilemma is extremely hard.

Most of the business leaders I've met haven't read this. 

### The key question

Here's a question: Why was the music industry disrupted?

What alternatives could have played out and who would have been responsible for those?

This is either a very simple question or very complex. It's usually answered by saying that a disruptive technology came along (except tapes disrupted CDs, which disrupted records - so that doesn't quite cut it). Or that the industry had an entrenched model (except it was used to making music free on radio in return for royalties, so that doesn't quite add up either). **Get a few more examples**.

As you dig into why an industry is disrupted you go through layers and layers of market and human behaviour. Entrenched business models, lack of awareness of new ways of doing things, people identifying with the craft instead of the outcome, lack of access to new kinds of customers. So on, down and down.


## Non-music examples of disruption

// TASK: 1-2 pages which list a bunch of obvious disruptions and some less so. Get across the idea that this happens all the time we just don't notice it. Perhaps start with some kind of hook / story which makes the reader realise how this happens lots. Or take the opposite tack: suggest that there have only been a few disruptions and then this section disproves that. Not sure... 

### Boats & Roads

All the stories of tech startups, new scientific inventions and feature wars donât compare with the simplicity of disruption which took place in Kinsale. The canonical disruption stories are predicated on new technologies and complex business models which, I find, confuse us from the simplicity of the situation.

Disruption is not a new phenomenon. It is not overly complex. It's probably just complicated by the fact that when it happens, the result is in the future and anything which happens in the future is usually hard to know about.

In 1665 someone wanted to challenge the existing business models, investments, careers of the Kinsale families with something entirely simple. Like a bridge.

> Innishannon Bridge, 9 miles upriver, was the cloest crossing to Kinsale until the nineteenth century. On 5 May 1665 Kinsale Corporation "resolved to oppose the payment of money towards Innishannon Bridge" as it gave access to territory south of the Bandon, having a detrimental effect on traffic and commerce through Kinsale. Shipping interests in Kinsale and Bandon argued that bridges interfered with movement on the river. Added to this, it was argued that the necessary infrastructure, roads and access would be a levy on the rates. 

From _Kinsale Harbour, A History. John Thuillier._

When your interests are in shipping, disruption can be as simple as a bridge. The beautiful image this conjured for me was of the Kinsale Corporation wracking their brains with these damned bridges. Why should people need more of them? Whatâs the point? Surely we are a boating people and we have boating interests to consider. We are people who sail. This is who we are and we have built up generations of knowledge, skills, equipment and culture around being in boats. Why bother with these bridges? There is no benefit and in fact there is a considerable potential loss.

You can imagine the discussions in the pubs and on the boats. Families anxiety of their future. Will their sons and daughters have the life that their parents had? Will their friends and society carry on?

I'm overplaying this somewhat, and I'm sure that the Kinsale Corporation's discussions weren't the drama I'm making them but the lesson we need to start with - and the question we need to take into our exploration of music - is that this disruption seems entirely normal and mundane, so how is it that we aren't used to talking about it being normal. 

When someone proposes building a bridge which we take the flow of goods away from us, the social and emotional part of disruption seems to be what makes disruption so hard to deal with. If organisations were totally dispassionate and made up of people who were ready to retrain at a momentâs notice while dropping all sense of professional (and perhaps cultural) identity, this would surely not be a problem. The organisation would recognise the need to change the business and everybody would teach themselves the new thing. Within days or perhaps a few weeks or months, the business, the society and families would be reinvented.

But that isnât what happens*.

What usually happens in response to a disruptive threat is that people first see it in terms of what they are *not*. Building on years of professional and social identity, they create an idea of what they are and the many things that they are not. They will also look at suppliers, partners and customers as what the are and what they are not. And what they want and what doesnât matter.

They turn an implicit, unspoken idea of their market into a cultural reality. This did exist before but, like all situations when we are presented with a foe, our sense of identity is heightened.

Already the idea of âwe areâ kicks in.

We are not an electricity company. Or a shipping company. Or an internet company. That is not our culture, our background, our skills.

We are a fishing company. We are not a bridge company.

This is perhaps where the death of the firm, industries and careers start: by too strongly associating with the activity and output rather than the underlying value. There is fundamentally no difference in the outcome value of moving things by river than by road, but there are many skill, professional and cultural values which build up in the activity of each. That one activity is more or less economical than the other is not a judgement on its value, even when disruption takes place. But as soon as you identify yourself as âa boating peopleâ, the argument is much less pragmatic.

Disruption pits methods and cultures against each other based on economics. Disruption makes it feel like everybody is being judged. The winners are right, the losers are wrong. But the winners and losers also build cultures around their activity. And so disruption feels like its judging your sense of self.

The misplaced sense of identity creates premature rigour mortis. Before the firm is actually dead, a paralysis of decision making, skills and capabilities causes it to narrow the scope of what itâs comfortable doing. It outsources anything new because this is not its âcore competencyâ while the emerging competition build the competencies which become critical. It looks at its past for guidance, while the emerging competition have no past and look only to the future, and  - crucially - tend to look only at the customers rather than âwhat we knowâ.

Itâs almost poetic to think of the decimation of industries and the confusion caused as something as simple as moving from a boat to a bridge. But, I believe thatâs exactly what the Kinsail story tells us. In 400 years time, the confusion, disruption and decimation of industries and jobs will appear as simple as a shift from a boat to a bridge.

Migrating an organisation (or an industry or a country) from doing one thing to another is simply retraining some humans and doing a different thing. There may also be some equipment involved, perhaps some legal things and some new suppliers. Nothing in that process is insurmountable.

The boaters of Kinsail could have been comfortable with the change if they had just thought: fine... we will either add carts to our business or move entirely to carts. Thatâs not a big thing.

But before the rational thought comes the emotional and highly identity-based thought. âWe are a boating family. We have been for generations. We have all these boats.â And we are back to reaction to the event, not reaction to the trend.

Beyond the effect of the thread of disruption, this charmingly simple story also teaches us to think about the flow of value and perhaps this is a way of thinking about disruption and layers of innovation. Before the bridges were even thought of, the value flowed through the routes of the boats. The roads and the boating routes defined where any ancillary value could be captured: inns and pubs, boat yards, light houses etc. All of these are on the route of value.

Grasping the idea of âroutes of valueâ is easy because we can see it. Itâs still true of physical shops: the higher the foot fall (the route of value) the higher the rents but also the higher the return. The further away from the route of value, the lower prices and the harder it is to earn.

When the idea of the bridge is presented (before they are built) the route of value is suddenly questioned in a way that it wasnât before. Are the boating routes that valuable? Clearly they are for the livelihoods of the boating families, but are they worth defending?

Similarly, as weâve seen this year (2020) more than ever, the route of value is not necessarily the high street. It is through little rectangles. Thatâs a physical reality - we have to accept this before we look at the economic of cultural shifts which might happen and how to react to them.

The same thing happened when the internet made everyone realise that the value in bookshops, record stores, CD sales and more were perhaps not as axiomatic as it seemed. The internet built bridges between creators and consumers in ways which bypassed the old institutions. The internet didnât do anything bad as such, it just reframed where the value lies.

Unfortunately, almost no leaders I have seen have this insight. They describe their own routes of value. They describe their boats.

One last point before we get into more modern frames of reference:

The brige was built.


### Money

_Banking, Money, Trade and Crypto_

(Money - book). Money should be affordable, durable, fungible, portable, reliable. This is why we adopted metals like gold, silver and bronze.

But even at the outset of looking at what money is, we start to notice that the way in which a money might be durable can change. And if money should be reliable, who exactly does this apply to? Reliable to everyone or just a few people? 

Do timeline of this.

Highlight that at each stage, each type of money (clay tablets, stone tablets, paper, banks, deposits etc) has a different purpose. It's solving a different problem. 

Then there are e.g. religious restrictions on what money/banking could be such as:
not charging interest
(check this) not lending to certain types of people - check. I think this was the case is some Arab countries. 

The evolution of money follows a similar evolution of other ideas/concepts/artefacts/technologies.

Early forms are direct and very literal. The value is for the user directly.

As the technology evolves, and as the number of parties involve increases so do specialisation in both the technology and the services around it. 

In money/banking this leads to 

2nd order / nth order impacts.
Money is an exchange of something. But then credit/loans, shares etc can be built on this.
Of course these can go wrong - tullips, housing booms, dot com nonsense. 

"The History of Banking Timeline | Sutori" - starts very late. Completely ignores a lot of history. Windowing. This is classic windowing - bringing in the window so it starts within the country and culture we are part of, which makes it feel like there is something exceptional about it.

"financialisation" is creating new technology on top of old.


We also see layers of technology adoption in money. As soon as I have money, the concept of owing and borrowing in terms of that money can exist - this exists millenia (Ascent of Money, 2nd Mill BC, Mesopotamia. There's an ancient IOU!)

We are familiar with the idea that money creates money and this IOU is just that - the IOU creates money in the future. If two people owe each other goods or money, they are dealing not just in the money which exists today but that which exists in the future. We don't really need specific historical examples to suspect that people must have realised they can owe things on behalf of other people - this is what trade would be built on. I travel across the sahara to buy food knowing that you will buy it from me when I return.

Do a graphic of this - this is like the S-curves. Or like layers of technologies. In this example, the money enabled trade / barter etc.

...

What we see in IOUs gets formalised in the Amsterdam Exchange Bank in 1609. (Ascent of Money, p48).
To enable easy flow of trade, regardless of currency or goods the Amsterdam Exchange Bank held accounts in standardised currencies. This enabled cheques, direct debits and transfers. 

[CHECK THIS] Merchants could make and receive payments via the bank. (What happened before this?)

However, the deposits and reserves remained closely linked - deposits were around c19 million [currency] and metalic reserves were c16 million. Credit creation requires decoupling deposits from reserves so that the bank can create money in the form of loans. 

p51. The core function of banking became "information gatherhing and risk management". 

p52. "...idea that money was about credit, not metal, never caught on in Madrid"

Money, banking, finance... evolved through people realising at each stage that the solution to one problem was a platform for a new solution. Deposits is the platform for loans. Common currencies of account is the platform for direct transfers between accounts. Loans are the platform for creation of money.

Each new innovation does multiple things at once:

It creates new value, seemingly out of nothing. Loans, shares, risk management all created secondary impacts and secondary industries where before there was none.

This value can shift the flow of power. The fact that Madrid didn't really get the idea that money was about credit rather than metal did two things: Madrid didn't get to participate in the banking and trade revolution to the same extent; by extension, Amsterdam got to exploit the new value created. These are two sides of the same coin, but it does tell us that a disruption or a change of the flow of value requires one party to be able to exploit the new value while another doesn't exploit it, either because they can't or because they don't see the point.

All of this opens up the next wave of value creation. This is especially true of money, which is a very generic type of value, but may be true of other types of new value creation. When the new value framework/paradigm is created, it's not always clear what the new, emergent types of value will appear atop it.

..

(p188, Ascent of Money)
Life insurance was invented [...give a bit of history...].

What is life insurance in terms of our ideas of layers of innovation and disruption? It didn't really "disrupt" any industry, but it did create one whereby people could be protected from the uncertainty of when they would die even if there was certainty that they would eventually die. [Get some more on this - presumably this allowed people to be more certain with their outlays of money.]

The prerequisits of life insurance are probability, life expectancy data, certainty, normal disruption, utility [DU] and inference [DU]. [Add para explaining these.]

Other prerequisits are, of course, money, banks, contracts and other norms of a financial and contract-based society. 

What is remarkable from our 21st century point of view is how absolutely normal these are - much of the maths involved in these is now taught in schools. Yet the entire life insurance industry dependend on these. And, in common with our observation of Madrid vs Ambsterdam [CHECK THIS], it's what this enables which is as interseting as what it is itself. 

[CHECK THIS] Once a family have life insurance for the main bread winner, presumably they are more comfortable making commitments which depend on that income. Without it, that money would be locked up as risk mitigation. We can see a similar pattern to the creation of credit by decoupling bank deposits from the money the bank can issue in loans. Whatever your view on the morality and sustainability of this, th decoupling of one form of money from another does allow a flod of new activity. The same thing, it seems is true of life insurance. [MUST GET STATS ON THIS]

p358. *Use this quote* ~Money is a mirror of mankind.

Money is well associated with corrupt behaviour. Money may be one of a handful for things in life that humans seem willing to bend and corrupt their moral compass, seemingly willing to do almost anything for a bit more. When we have a society where people don't just have the option of making money but have to make money (for example, to pay for rent, increasing price of food, safety etc) we ask fewer and fewer questions over the ethics of the work and the 2nd, 3rd, and nth order impacts of the work we are doing.

That's a big discussion which is beyond the scope of this book, but there's something worth noticing with the ways in which money can corrupt and they types of money involved in allowing the corruption to take place. Global trade of commodities such as sugar, cotton and slaves was made possibly in part by financialisation at a scale not previously possible. If we take the idea of that money is a mirror of mankind but we also add in the fact that all this trade was also made possible by a confluence of inventions (such as sailing, steam, etc) then perhaps it's not money which is the mirror but all layers of innovation.

The question this raises is: perhaps all new inventions, disruptions/innovations are a different mirror of mankind. Each time there is a new idea or new invention and new flow of value, humans have another chance to reflect on who they really are. _This question has to carry over into the main body of the book_

..

Bitcoin.

One of the most interesting and, more recently, contencious innovations in money has be cryptocurrency.

It's instructive to take a much more considered view of cryptocurrency based on what we're learning about how innovations and disruptions embed themselves into society. We've only had about a decade of this idea in common use, and it's based on a relatively new network (the internet). Before we judge cryptocurrency as an idea and perhaps bitcoin specifically, let's see what questions the evolution of bitcoin raises for us in our mission to understand disruption.

p10. "Where money comes from".
The bitcoin community, and the cypherpunks before them saw was that they questioned what it was money had become. As we've seen in a short history of money, it's not obvious what money is and there are more types of money that simple the thing you use to buy stuff with. And on top of each of those types of money, there are secondary networks of value which aren't open to all of us. There's an insight here that the bitcoin/crypto community had that is a parallel to the Amsterdam [??] Bank, perhaps: if we create a new common way of trade we can create new forms of value on top of this. For Amsterdam the common way of trade was common currency accounts. For bitoin and crypto, it requires building a new form of digital money.

But in order to get to the conclusion that a new form of money is required, they first needed to see through what was already there. They couldn't just build on what everyone else was using. This is an interesting twist - perhaps not all innovation builds on top of the latest and most common innovation. If there was, bitcoin and crypto would have built on top of the existing fiat currencies and the existing banking systems. Our S-curves of adoption might not be so simple.

p14. [My notes: "Yap. Big rocks." WTF...?!]
We also see that the crypto community saw that the concept of money was not static. This is backed up by our short history of money. While we have nice, neat definitions of what money is, these are only good for the examples the world has seen and taken seriously so far. The phenomenon I believe we're seeing here is a definition problem: we define things based on what we are aware of and then we categorise the world based on that. When something comes along which challenges that, often by first digging deeper into where that defintion came from then that something can play havoc with our definitions and categories. _Carry this question over into the main body of the book. This is all about definition of style._

p19. Previous versions of digital money.
[haven't got notes on this].
Bitcoin is the version of digital money which broken through and achieve global reach and recognition, but it's not the first idea of digital money and is not the first time people have thought of such a thing.

Failed attempts are important. We spend a lot of time discussing why one thing won over another and what it means about life, society, humans, etc etc. But perhaps the question we need to ask is: _what do the previous/failed attempts at something mean?_

p32. Cyperpunks.
The cyperpunks lived on messaging boards in the [which years???]. At the time, the number of people on these boards was [GET THIS] X% of the population. The number of people who knew about these ideas was vanishingly small. Around this time, the ideas of innovation in money were [GET THIS].

Here's another interesting question: why is it that this innovation came out of the shaddows? Wouldn't it make sense that the place where the information sits - the banking sector - is where the innovation should come from. Of course, if you've worked in anything like this you'll have quick answers as to why this isn't the case but from the outside it's not obvious why the innovations and disruptions don't come from the incumbents.

Bank 2.0

Internet trading. When trading of stocks on the internet started being opened up to consumers, it was often done under the idea of "democratising investment". ("Democratising" is short hand for making something available to more people - I haven't researched this, but I assume the use of a word related to "democratic" is partly because the underlying idea is taken to be inherently good.) Years later, we have apps like Rohinhood which saw [get a short history of this], effectively encouraging people to invest in numbers which were going up rather than the underlying value of anything. Perhaps this is tullip mania all over again, just like the first Dot Com book. Bubbles, after all, will happen again and again.

What questions / ideas does this leave us with? As layers of innovations and disruptions emerge, how do we know which ones are good and which ones are bad? Or, perhaps we need a less judgemental view of this.

Maybe we need to look, not at the goodness or badness of each potential innovation or disruption but at the nth order impacts - what these impacts might be, who they might impact and the extent. _Carry this question into main body of the book. I don't know the answer though._

p225. "Banks have cost-cut...", "status quo"
What we learn from the behaviour of the banks during the first phase of digital disruption on finance was that, [quote] they cut costs and focus on the status quo. This gives us the question of: why do the incumbents behave like this and why, despite so many historical examples of this behaviour resulting in long term harm is this behaviour repeated?

But these behaviours are not about complex decisions - they are simple things like what should be displayed on the bank's website. [Get examples from the book - ideally interview Brett ??, author of Bank 2.0/3.0/4.0]. Anyone who's worked in anything customer-facing will be familiar with the experience that decisions are made from the business's point of view rather than what the customer actually wants. Simple things like what is useful to a customer on a website doin't factor into the priorities and decisions of the bank because, for one, the bank defines itself as dealing with customers through branches and not through websites. Websites are a necessary evil but not a point of value, from the incumbents point of view. Once the idea that this new thing has low value, all resourcing and priortisation decisions make this an inconvenence.

If we think about the history and disruption of banking and money, it's easy to see the shift from barter to money to banks to online banking and then crypto. Basically, to look just at money as a way of buying things in the momeny. Money is more complex than this though - it's a store of value, it has a future value, its value depends on what's going on in the economy, and there are different types of money - central banks, commercial banks, consumer, cash etc.

Money is a particularly interesting one when it comes to the flow of value.

If we compare one form of money to another, we can see different available flows of value to different people. In the beginning there was no money and there wasn't even barter. You forrage or hunt for food and you have the value you need. There is no storage, no future value. If we barter then value from my activity has found its way into your life - there are overlapping flows of value in our activity. (This is like a cross-roads or X shape.)

When I learn to preserve food, I prolong the value of my activity into the future.

If we introduce a coin or token of some kind, we enable flows of value which are not only geographical but through time. We have created a network of possible trade.

If you make a bank, and I deposit my cash in your bank to withdraw in the future we have done multiple things: my accumulated money becomes more useful to me because I don't have to look after it; I don't need to have a safe or other storage. But you can now lend that. Yet more flows of value.

However, you have become a gatekeeper to whoever can borrow from you. While we have created flows of value we have not made these flows available to everyone. 

This is illustrated in the case of the East India company when they created a system to take deposits in [find out where] and allow withdrawls [find out where]. This does two things: it solves a problem that the East India company had in getting money from X to Y but it also, by design, it excludes a lot of people from (legitimate and illegitimal) access to that money. Their system wasn't designed or built to allow just anyone to move money from X to Y, it was designed as a very specific flow of very specific value for very specific people.

A lot of money systems are exactly this way. They allow a very specific form of value to be stored/exchanged between very specific entities. It's not true that each progression from one technology to another is an improvement of everything, nor is it a (dis?!)improvement. So what happens?

These 1-dimensional timelines can be unsatisfactory. Perhaps each new method / innovation is sequential but not a straight improvment - it's more about trade offs. And not just in the technology itself but in where the technology can be applied. 


This tells us that the progression from one technology to another is not

### #NEXT Broadcasting

_Information platforms & broadcast media_

One of the 2nd order effects of computing has been increased communication platforms. When we think of communication, we probably think of things like the telephone, email and social media.

However, like computing itself it's better to see the trend of these platforms as a continuation of the human need to communicate and to broadcast information. This allows us to ignore the specific technologies and look more at the implications of the technologies and, more importantly, the 2nd/3rd/nth order effects.

We will look at broadcasting first. Broadcasting is the human need to get a message across to many people.

Theatre
Email lists
Blogs
Social - sub-groups
YouTube
TikTok

As we see progression of the information platforms, we see that new nuances are important. TikTok is, in effect the same as YouTube but the arrangement of the information within the medium (video on mobile device) brings new nuances. These naunces are easy to ignore if you're being disrupted - it all looks like same: video on you own website, on Vimeo, on YouTube, or TikTok is all video. Except that the progression introduces nuance.


If we go back

How do we measure the "improvements"? Cost, speed, density of information / bandwidth, network size.

Measuring improvements quickly leads to the intuition that each wave of disruption is not necessarily an improvement. We know this because we have in person meetings when we need to convey more but email when the information is (perhaps) more routine. 




### Machines for thinking (AI)

(See sources: Chapter Zero; AI)
(Take some examples from Illustrated history)

AI means voice recognition, unmanned drones and a machine in the cloud choosing your next book or film. When we ask about the disruptive impacts of AI are, we end up answering questions which relate to today - the AI replaces the call centre, the drone pilot and the librarian. However, if we take a broader view of AI, starting much, much earlier than today's AI we end up learning more.

AI for our purposes is about tools or machines which help humans think or immitate a human's thinking. Humans have a centuries- or millenia-old project to offload mental effort onto external devices or, our of pure interest to see if external devices can perform the same tasks as humans.

We see AI as much about the abacus and the weighing scale as about deep neural networks and vast quantities of data. This means, as we explore what AI means for understanding disruption in general, we won't actually learn a lot about how AI will or won't disrupt industries by starting to speculating over what its impacts will be over the next 10, 20 or 100 years. If we do this we will just end up parotting the same old speculations. 

Our main interest here is not necessarily the inner workings of the AI but the impact of AI. We are as interested by the naive ELIZA chatbot built in the 19XXs as we are in a cutting edge, neural network powered virtual therapist. The underlying technology less less interesting than the impact.

This means we are also less focused on a pure idea of "intelligence" which may mean something sentient or approaching selfawareness, but we are more focused on AI as artificial thinking machines. Any machine which in some way does what a brain could do. Why? Because we are interested here in the impact of these artificial thinking machines on what it means to be human.

And this leads to a third interest. Artificial Intelligence sounds, to our modern ear, almost synonmous with Artificial Humans. It plays into, and threatens our ideas of identity. The threat of identity, it seems, becomes a core feature of disruption. With AI, the closer it gets to doing what we define as essentially human the more we have to defend why being human isn't what the AI does, it's what a human does. But this argument either doesn't hold or it's the wrong argument to have. If an AI called AlphaGo can play the game Go not just as well as a human but so much better that it invents new moves which humans would not have thought of[get ref] has AlphaGo become more human than a human?

...

***history starts here***

NEXT: Tell a series of stories.

The history of artificiant intelligence is series of stories either of offloading human cognative effort onto a machine or exploring how a machine might be like a human. 

We have built tools to help us think and to help us make decisions for a long time. 

THe abacus and [get other] counting machines augment the human's ability to make a decision about how much of something there is or how that thing could be shared between multiple parties. This is not at all a trivial example and the fact that the only place you can find an abacus these days is in a child's nursery / playroom doesn't reflect how useful a device this is.

Counting with real things is not child like - an Excel file or database is effectively just a modern version of an abacus from this point of view. Rather than perform the calculations in my mind, they are performed externally. I gain two things from this: a machine which helps me calculate; a way of externalising the calculation which would otherwise me happening in my mind.

Rather than having to explain my working to you, I can show you it. And if I need to stop part way through the calculation I can do and the abacus remembers for me. In this way, the abacus is an artificial thinking machine in both the calculation and the communication. It also serves a purpose of communicating the working - I can put the beads in a particular position and then you could take over from me.

Weighing scales also take subjective weight decisions and make them objective. Clockwork divides time, but also makes possible other processes which can be mechanised and regularised. 

Each of these are not typically thought of as AI but if we look at the impact, it is the same as autonomous drones and [...]. The impact is that they take work away from the human and transfer it into an object. At this scale, though, it probably has minimal impact on the lives of those around the the person using the tool, certainly compared with the impact of AIs running at the scale they do today.

===

As we move into a more typical history of AI we pick up all kinds of ideas, questions, clues as well as uneasy feelings about the human condition. It's these feelings of identity which, I believe, sit at the heart of why disruption of industries by AI feels so undermining to what it means to be human.

We will now whizz through this and, at the end, regroup and see what this set of technologies has told as about the causes and impacts of disruption.

>>> Add in other examples here --. from the history book.

>> Remove??

As we progress to electronics, the value made possible a very specific piece of human behaviour which enabled a gigantic world of possibilities. By focusing on switches - turning electric current on and off, values were able to be turned into machines which could count.

Binary calculations persisted as computing power increased, but the underlying technology shifted from values to solid state electronics. We have lived through this revolution and we have felt the effects, but it's worth spending time reflecting on the impact. The tiny world of binary calculations has led to almost every industry's communication being rebuilt on top of something electronic. Like the telephone enabling completely new flows of value, electronics changes _where_ the work was done which changes availabel flows of value.

We then follow this artificial intelligence / automation / mechanisation of the human capabilities through mainframes, increased computing power, larger networks through to AI.

>>I will have done several pages on AI history.
>>Continue from here

What has a quick study of AI's historical disruptive impacts on humanity told us about disruption in geneeral? And what questions will we take into our study of music?

Let's look at causes vs impacts. Remember that, for our purposes, we weren't directly interested in the underlying mechanics. We were interested in the impacts. What is obvious from this quick study is that the 1st order impact, that a human has a powerful machine doesn't really tell us the story of either the cause or the effect.

Instead we are interested in the 2nd, 3rd- or nth-order effect. How do we think about these?

Next, it's clear that AI either has or is about to do something to question what it means to be human. What question does this raise about disruption? I suggest this is about identity. While the impacts of the abacus and the weighing scale might have not really had the impact of questioning who we are has humans, the way humans have used tables of inventory and used counting technology in banking have changed what it means to be human.  

Over the past 40 years we have seen what it means to be a designer change from pen and paper, to clunky computers through to cloud based realtime artboards. The AI may not be HAL, but it's drawing perfectly round circles and perfectly straight lines. Those used to be things people practiced.

What will it mean to create visual, audio, film or written content in 20 years? It's hard to imagine that it will look like what it does today. Even the simple act of sending emails involves an AI helping to finish my sentences. We haven't really felt the imapct of the latest large-scale generative AI models which can write and rewrite in various styles.

AI can generate code by reading the vast repository of code we've put on the internet over the past 20 years. What will it mean to be a programmer?

The creative community, which may be one of the last purely human endevours left where logic is less important than intuitiion has yet to fully digest the impact of generate AI. I have created pages of text with AI. I've created album covers. I've created synthesier sounds and samples.

If it feels clunky and buggy now, just remember what the internet felt like in the 90s.

The question we take into our exploration of music, is how to think about identity. Why is it that AI is challenging what it means to be human? Why is the question of identity coming up at all?

### #NEXT Devices (Smartphones, laptops)

_Smartphone vs laptop/desktops_

In the previous example, we looked at a series of technologies under the heading of "communication" technology but this undersells the impact they had. Landline phones didn't just allow communication between people, it allowed trading of stocks around the world - or maybe it was the telegraph which enabled that. Either way, the communication technology allowed the communication of very different types of messages which have very different types of value. Phoning your uncle in another country to talk about your visit has a very different impact to spending 4 hours on a transatlantic call to negotiate buying a company.

The shift from desktops/laptops to smartphone did exactly this. The smartphone didn't just absorb the value that landline phones previously held, but myriad other things. Music, photography, socialising, film, banking and many other things.

The interesting thing is that this value was finally, after a few false starts put into the marketplace by Apple. The false starts [...General Magic...].

The important observation here is the shift in Apple's own value from computers to smartphones, and the many layers of value which were built on top of that.

They were able to create their own value. 

This is a story which has been picked apart a million times and I don't think analysing this is going to bring new insight. What we need to ask was, what way of seeing the world did they have which allowed them to move so confidently into an area that they had tried and failed in before? (The smartphone was basically a PDA, which the Newton was but that failed.)

The easy thing to do here is to look at what people at Apple did to create the iPhone. This is what a lot of business books do - they give you case studies in how the people who did the thing did the thing. That's perfectly useful and you should read those books, but that's not what we're going to do here. I don't think that's a particularly useful exercise because you end up cargo culting [introduce the idea here or earlier on - maybe in the intro with all the silly things that organisations do]. What we need to ask is: what were the deeper ideas or motivations which allowed Apple to detact itself from being in the business of building desktop computers and allowed it to build a new generation of computing?

In order to answer a question like this, case studies won't entirely answer the question because each case study is a sample of what happened. It's an example of one set of humans in one circumstance who reacted in one partciular way. If you know any amount of statistics you know that one measurement is not data - annecdote is not the same as data.

My contention is that to learn about how Apple pivoted from one technology to another we need to look at how other pivots have happened - in this book we will us music and explore how pivots from one instrument to another, from one musical system to another, from one form of music to another. 

What underlies this is a believe that the creativity of the human brain is working in the same way across many domains. 

//Get some stats on this. 

//Apple created a new place for new value. 
//Use the picture of all the things which ended upon on the smartphone. 

### Amazon vs publishers

Music could be disrupted by the internet because the raw material of music - sound - is easily captures and disrupted. Books should have followed the same pattern but something about the way we consumer books in all its forms meant it didn't follow quite the same. 

Slightly inferiour copies of music using the new mp3 technology of the 90s [check] compared favourably with the CDs and tapes we'd become used to. Perhaps there was a little loss of quality, but overall the gist of the experience remained the same. But books seem different.

The battle, as its termed by the incumbents, was similar though. 

Project Gutenburg, started by Michael Hart in [??] to [digitise public domain material] was the preserve of enthusiasts and nerds. Whether it was from this project or somewhere else, I certainly remember downloaded reems and reems of public material and printing it out in 8-point to reduce the number of pages I had to pay for. The behaviour of early adopters doesn't always translate into the behaviour of masses though, and this kind of effort of searching, downloading, reformating and printing was very unlikely to ever be adopted by the masses.

..

ebooks were first popularised when devices allowed the end-to-end experience to be seemless. To anyone who had been using the internet to find and read material, it made perfect sense that the internet would be the distribution platform for books. What seemed to be missing was the consumer experience. There are important lessons here.

Amazon, with their Kindle, Google with search and Apple with iPad all created ways of closing the gap between the consumer impulse and discovering (and possibly buying) a book.

- âWe had high hopes that this would happen eventually, but we never imagined it would happenthis quickly,â said Jeff Bezos, Amazonâs chief executive, in a statement. âWeâve been sellingprint books for 15 years and Kindle books for less than four years.â

This quickly became controvertial as each of Amazon, Google and Apple did things which the publishers and authors, who own of the intellectual property, found objectionable. These include allowing ebooks to undercut the price of physical books (which creates incentives to buy digital rather than physical), providing free search-inside via Google search and other price fixing practices.

//

Amazon had developed the ebook specifically for reducing the steps consumers needed to take to search, buy and read a book. In their case, the technology was developed around the user need of searching and reading. When they created the Kindle marketplace and the user base, this was created in the private domain. These are Amazon users on Amazon devices. 

This enabled them to play with the pricing and distributino / access rules however they liked. They can set prices - initially prices were set below market rate, undercutting the publishers and authors but, presuambly providing utility to consumers. 

Google created a similar environment for themselves; once user are coming to the Google search box every day and expecting good search results, Google could add a little more value here and there. When a user is doing a Google search, they are very unlikely to go to another site to do a book search. The entire experience is inherenetly owned by Google. 

Google's missions, to organise the world's information and make it searchable, is clear to users and helpful. There is no user who wants to spend longer finding the thing they're looking for, so the value of Google is instantly understandable to users once they realise how much information is in the world. Adding books onto this isn't a huge leap.

Apple, lastly, had created first the iPod then iPhone and then iPad. With each of these, they realised either right away or soon after that the secondary value to the core product could be gigantic. The iPod led to interesting reasons for non-Apple users to have at least one Apple device because that's where all the great music was and, when iTunes was available for PCs, why not buy this as it's the only decent music player.

Apple did with the iPod what Amazon did with the Kindle, but each was approaching a different user problem and from the point of view of a different type of company. This is important because the type of company you are affects the kinds of things you see as valuable for customers, for the world and for yourself.

When tech commentators talk about Google being an information or AI company, Apple being a hardware company and Facebook being ad company there is more to these comments than simply explaining how they tend to make their money. The kind of company you are affects where you see and exploit value.

And this is what we saw. Each of these new entrants into publishing - Amazon, Google and Apple - looked at books from a different angle. Amazon saw books initially as a good category of product to sell on the internet and then it saw ebooks as a way providing extra value to users within the Amazon ecosystem. They were able to analyse which pages on which books were actually read and even which sections were highlighted. This was a far, far closer relationship between provider and reader than publishers had ever had.

Google saw books as a way of adding value to the user of search. Users clearly want to be able to search through all of the world's information, so why not allow them to search through books and view the results? Especially if the books are public domain. This leads to more use of Google's search.

And Apple wanted more reasons to use iPad, the iPhone and other Apple devices. If users can find, buy and read on Apple devices then the utility of those devices increases.

Amazon wants you buying from Amazon. Google wants you searching on Google. Apple wants you using Apple devices. None of this is controversial. Statements like this are either implicity but not hidden or stated openly in their strategies and, because each of these companies had built up a large user base whenever they introduced something new into it the effect was outsized. 

This didn't lead directly to the surge in ebooks, but it certainly enabled it. The publishing world should have been looking at the internet and the growth of reading devices (such as Kindle, iPad and smartphones) as the creation of potential sources of value for readers. No amount of saying that _people prefer to read on paper_ matters when people discover they can take one kindle on holiday instead of a suitcase of books.

>>TODO: Add a new lesson to "value". New value is seen by new entrants.

>>TODO: Make sure (in "value") there is "potential value", which is something incumbents must pay attention to. 


When researching for this book, I was surprised by how unresolved this matter seems. Even at the start of 2022, Amazon and publishers hae been accused of price fixing ebooks.

> Jan 2022 - "Amazon.com and the âBig Fiveâ publishers â Penguin Random House, Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan and Simon & Schuster â have been accused of colluding to fix ebook prices, in a class action filed by the law firm that successfully sued Apple and the Big Five on the same charge 10 years ago."

In the cases, going back more than a decade [check] the publishers acuse Amazon and Google of not playing on a level playing field. They acuse the new entrants of using their overly strong market power to use predatory pricing and "systematic below-cost pricing of books to squash competition in the book selling industry as a whole".

What quesitons does this give us?

1. Why didn't the publishers build this for themselves? The technology was well known and the idea of ebooks has been thought of for years. In the 1990s, the publishes were stronger than they are now. So perhaps there's a lesson about incuments or competitors acting together.

2. Why did publishers and other book lovers bother talking about how print is better than screens/e-ink? In the long run, being right didn't matter more than actually building the thing.

3. The internet un-levelled the playing field. Despite the publishers complaining about Amazon's practices, the fact that publishers deliberately release the more expensive hardback book following by cheaper paperback and ebooks is, itself, a form of price fixing. There's something about the status quo being fair and level until something comes along and makes it clear why things aren't fair and level.

4. Do things converge to fair over the long term? Or does the market stay skewed? This isn't at all clear and looking at the exmaples of music and ebooks, it's not clear that we have ended anywhere "fair" so perhaps we need to look at how markets (of various kinds) pan out over the medium and long term. 

5. Is a fair, level market good for innovation and progress?

6. How you define unfair depends on how you define a market. This is somewhat intellectual slight of hand, but it's not wrong.

7. Many articles about Amazon vs publishers, talk about the "fight" the publishers are putting up. On what fronts do incumbents tend to fight and is this worth doing when the new intrant will have created new flows of value, effectively reframing the entire question?



### Uber vs taxis

Have a few of the canonical examples of digital disruption.

### AirBnB vs hotels

### *Other forms of disruption - Covid*

These forms of disruption change the flow of value

Increased time online
massive decrease in foot fall. Thisis very easy to visualise but it's a direct example of "flows of value" <-- i need to introduce this idea without using that phrase too early.




## Temper the argument

Things that can't be disrupted or don't create new, long 

Tullips - no real long term value
The frozen water trade - wasted effort
Gamestop = no underlying value
Education = the hardest part of education is the human brain


Disruption does not always mean reducing overall value.
E.g. Uber - more cabs after it was introduced.
Music - (get a stat on this). More music is listened to now.


Disruption doesn't always mean better things for everyone. We have grown expert at arbitrage with positive outcomes for one set of people but very negative outcomes for others. Cheap clothes, technology, energy all have impacts on other people.


Also, it's not true that everything is changing faster than ever. [Get some data for this]. Some things are changing rapidly when viewed from a certain light: the changes in how people consume content are changing almost by the week, with content/social platforms becoming every more expert in keeping our attention. However, the way I fix the pointing (that's the cement between the bricks) on the front of my house is pretty much what it would have been 100 years ago when the house was built, or 500 or 1000 years ago.

There are strata of change. The top layer changes rapidly, the lower layers change slowly.

Old vs new value. New value is not necessarily better or worse than old. A lot of time is spent by incumbents explaining why we need to protect our institutions or by disruptors explaining that we need to embrace the future. I am firmly in neither camp. 


New / disruptive value doesn't mean that fundamental good business practice disappears. The Dot Com boom, which saw valuations detacted from reality or the Tullip mania [of the XXXX century] show that we lose track of reality. We are in a closed system - finite resources, finite time and a biological need to eat, socialise and provide for ourselves. This means that, while you can borrow from the future you do have to pay it back.


## Slave trade; Climate; Migration

*Move this to ~last*

Trading of slaves obviously disrupted, in an horrific way, the lives of millions of people. It happened because the enslavers realised they could capture value in one place and get new value for it elsewhere, a practice in trade called arbitrage; buy it cheap in one place in order to sell it for more elsewhere.

These kinds of change happen all the time.

Disruption can mean a bit of a shift in how we consume something or the theft of natural resources and lives. Putting a smartphone app and geopolitics on the same axis might be extreme - I'm not really sure how this will fair, but from the examples we've seen there are common questions around the flows of value and [ADD MORE]

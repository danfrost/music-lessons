# Music Lessons - on one page

Music is a strange microcosm of everything human: transient, cultural, technological, emotional, organised, chaotic. The turn of this century saw music’s industry utterly disrupted. There are obvious lessons but, when you dig you find far more lessons.

Why does this matter?

For multiple reasons, we are living at a time when we need more, different, bigger and better ideas. We have achieved a lot through industrialisation, capitalism, communications and all the associated progress. But we are, at the same time, awash with an endless supply of pointless industries and activities. Social media connected us but they sold our attention. The bulk of our political life is spent discussing, not the nuance of an idea or how to progress it but some vague, partisan or personality issue which hardly makes an impact on the problems we ought to be solving. We have entire industries designed to trick people into parting with their money for things which will bring no long term value to humanity, solve no problems and arguably will just reinforce the shallow, cultural deadends.

IN THIS BOOK YOU WILL LEARN:

- Understand the ways that we see the world... which trick us into thinking everything is stable
- Where value comes from; and where is can shift to
- The mistakes people make when seeing how their industry might look in the future
- New ways of looking at how industries are affected by disruption

Despite nearly 30 years of information technology progress, we spend a gigantic portion of our time copying and pasting information from one system we hate into another. Our productivity may not have improved according to pre-internet measures [get/check these], so perhaps the productivity is buried in new forms such as our ability to create and share information for free and instantly? Maybe, but we all know of the huge increase in noise and nonsense these technologies have created.

How do we get out of the societal and commercial rut? Where do we look for ideas which will make us see what systems we are wallowing in? How can we think really differently rather than just copying the thinking of whichever hero of commerce is on the cover of whichever magazine we happen to be leafing through?

Everything new requires fusing together material from multiple places. From photosynthesis, which fuses [photons and ??] to create…, to [find another example], the fundamental activity of creativity is bringing unlikely ideas together. All breakthroughs in human activity require fusing ideas together to create something new. 

What I bring is exactly that: a fusing of unlikely ideas in a way which, I hope, sparks some new ways of looking at the rut we're in. My offering is an unusual study of music.

I am also not going to put any artist, style, school of thought or movement on a pedestal as this takes us down a dangerous alley of thought which ends either in confirmation bias, praising of geniuses or giving up. I am also not going to present you with biographies of famous composers, because you will only end up looking for the same lessons - confirmation bias of what you want to hear.

Instead, we can use music, which is a peculiarly human phenomenon around which we have built various cultures and industries as a microcosm to understand how to see ourselves as humans; how to see ourselves before, during and after major change; and how to get out of the mental models which lock us in.
[This all needs redrafting - I’m using too many phrases which make sense to me]

The disruption of music has also come at the start of a century which promises yet more disruption, be it through changes of geopolitical power, migration spurred by climate, war or the hope of a better life. And whatever else comes along. Napster's disruption of the music industry was strangely prescient.

How might this help the bigger problems?

We humans are too easily locked into ways of thinking through language, culture and convention. We forget that everything around us which was created by a human was created by a human like us. Especially in the west, we have a hierarchical idea of human creativity where those who make are at the top and those who consume are underneath and must follow.

If we are going to make the big leaps in industry, politics, culture and any other area, we need to be able to identify what of the current world is real, what is made up by humans, how to identify different ways of seeing things/thinking about things and where the new ideas come from.

To close this opening, I have been accidentally researching the economics history of music since the turn of the century. The ideas which come from some unusual areas of research, such as the philosophy of the concept of a music work have, for me, unlocked completely different ways of seeing the world.

Another reason why I feel compelled to write this is that in professional life we are too grown up. Too sensible. Too professional. We narrow what we talk about, ruling out anything which isn’t part of the culture or purpose of the business. All play, exploration and childlike trivialities are not allowed. 

Yet, as we’ll see repeatedly throughout, it’s these trivialities where new ideas are found. We need a fresh injection of ideas all the time otherwise we become stale and pointless. These ideas do not come from your favourite business networking site or business magazine, but unlikely places. By definition, they have to to.

So my other reason for writing this is to break the patterns of thinking, introduce a new and potentially confusing idea. ((What Khurshed called a deliberate confusion **get the quote *)) And with that, give you a new way of looking at whatever you need to be doing.

What follows are XNUMBERX lessons taken from different ways of looking at music - as an industry, a practice, a culture. These lessons fall into:

_The structures we created; flows and networks; the medum; ... etc ... list the sections._

These ideas have lived almost exclusively in my notebooks for years only to come out when I'm trying to solve a particular strategy problem or understand why something in the world has happened. As with so many ideas, either there is something useful there or they are the ravings and scribblings of someone who has spent too long with their own thoughts. I leave that judgement to you.

# Music Lessons - on one page

Hello! I'm looking for some feedback on a book idea I've been working on for a while. It looks at how the disruption to the music industry is a lense through which we can understand the disruption which will happen over the rest of this century. It's not what you'd expect - the history goes back further, the technology goes wider and the psychology (possibly biology) goes deeper. I'm looking for some feedback on a 2-3 page summary.

Message me if you can share a bit of time to give some feedback. 

Thank you!

# Summary

Music is a strange microcosm of everything human: transient, cultural, technological, emotional, organised, chaotic. The turn of this century saw the industry we think of as music utterly disrupted, all but destroyed. While there are obvious lessons, it turns out that if you dig deeper you find far more lessons.

We learn that how we frame something's history dictates how we see its future. Normal is both not average and not static. The flow of value changes over time, but not simply to a new version of an old thing - sometimes new types of value emerge. How you think about value determines whether you see progress or decline. But, regardless of your view, things keep changing.

I could have written this about many industries from food to commodities, fashion t art, literature to sports. My reason for using music as a lense through which to view disruption, innovation and change is because I graduated in music around the time the internet started eating away at the music industry. This led me to research the economic history of music, which has led me back here - to reflect on how the disruptions, choas, unfairness, destruction and creation are all normal, mundane and somewhat poetic. And that the ideas from this industry might help us think about other industries.

Why does this matter?

We are living at a time when we need more, different, bigger and better ideas. We have achieved a lot through industrialisation, capitalism, communications and all the associated progress but we are, at the same time, awash with an endless supply of pointless industries and activities. Social media connected us but then they sold our attention. Our political life is spent discussing, not the nuance of an idea or how to progress it but some vague, partisan or personality issue which hardly makes an dent in the problems we ought to be solving. We have entire industries designed to trick people into parting with their money for things which will bring no long term value to humanity, solve no problems and arguably will just reinforce the shallow, cultural deadends.

Despite nearly 30 years of information technology progress, we spend a gigantic portion of our time copying and pasting information from one system we hate into another. Our productivity may not have improved according to pre-internet measures [get/check these], so perhaps the productivity is buried in new forms such as our ability to create and share information for free and instantly? Maybe, but we all know of the huge increase in noise and nonsense these technologies have created.

How do we get out of the societal and commercial rut? Where do we look for ideas which will make us see what systems we are wallowing in? How can we think really differently rather than just copying the thinking of whichever hero of commerce is on the cover of whichever magazine we happen to be leafing through?

Everything new requires fusing together material from multiple places. From photosynthesis, which fuses [photons and ??] to create…, to [find another example], the fundamental activity of creativity is bringing unlikely ideas together. All breakthroughs in human activity require fusing ideas together to create something new. 

What I bring is exactly that: a fusing of unlikely ideas in a way which, I hope, sparks some new ways of looking at the rut we're in. My offering is an unusual study of music, in which I personally find huge richness of ideas.

This is not, though, an endless sycophantic blurb about my top 10 western male composers. This is part of the problem - even the way we tend to study the history of music is typical of the way we approach ideas. We think of it as a narrow frame of reference.

I am also not going to put any artist, style, school of thought or movement on a pedestal as this takes us down a dangerous alley of thought which ends either in confirmation bias, praising of geniuses or giving up. I am also not going to present you with biographies of famous composers, because you will only end up looking for the same lessons - confirmation bias of what you want to hear.

Instead, we can use music, this peculiar human phenomenon around which we have built various cultures and industries, as a microcosm to understand how to see ourselves as humans; how to see ourselves before, during and after major change; and how to get out of the mental models which lock us in.

Studying music in this way is also timely. Music, in a way, set the scene for our century.

The disruption of music come at the start of a century which promises yet more disruption, be it through changes of geopolitical power, migration spurred by climate, war or the hope of a better life; or through technological change, financial shifts in power or financial innovations which may untie us from institutions or tie us to them in stronger ways.

Napster's disruption of the music industry was strangely prescient, demonstrating what happens when an industry and a culture think that they understand their value.

How might this help the bigger problems?

We humans are too easily locked into ways of thinking through language, culture and convention. We forget that everything around us which was created by a human was created by a human like us. We have a hierarchical idea of human creativity where those who make are at the top and those who consume are underneath and must follow. We need to think better of ourselves.

If we are going to make the big leaps in industry, politics, culture and any other area, we need to be able to identify what of the current world is real, what is made up by humans, how to identify different ways of seeing things/thinking about things and where the new ideas come from.

There is a problem, though. A reason why you'll think this is all utter nonsense.

In professional life we are too grown up. Too sensible. Too professional. We narrow what we talk about, ruling out anything which isn’t part of the business or the culture. There is work and there is play. There is learning, which is where someone else intructs you and then there is doing, which you can get paid for.

What nonsense. All human progression is made through a confusing, sometimes unhealthy mix of what we are taught combined with rambling walks through mistakes, disasters, sketching, playing and, sometimes progress. Playful does not mean wasteful - it means observing an idea and seeing what emerges. Playful is looking at something you notice every day and wondering if there's something new about it.

For many serious professionals, this book would be better left on the bookshelf. Walk away. Bank to the job (which someone else invented). Stick to what the world knows. Don't suspend disbelief. Everything is fine.

If you aren't a serious professional (and I hope you're not), let's play with some trivial ideas. It’s these trivialities where new ideas are found. We need a fresh injection of ideas all the time otherwise we become stale and pointless. These ideas do not come from your favourite business networking site or business magazine, but unlikely places. By definition, they have to to.

So my other reason for writing this is to break the patterns of thinking, introduce a new and potentially confusing idea. 

These ideas have lived almost exclusively in my notebooks for years only to come out when I'm trying to solve a particular strategy problem or understand why something in the world has happened. As with so many ideas, either there is something useful there or they are the ravings and scribblings of someone who has spent too long with their own thoughts. I leave that judgement to you.

# CONTENTS

_Below are the chapters I have planned. Each is an unusual observation of music and how it might make is see things differently. Each will have stories, examples and ways of translating this into practice._

## PART 1: WINDOWS & STRUCTURES

1. Windows hide the truth. We narrow our field of view either by time, geography or some other factor to suit the judgement we want. 

2. Structures create value. Without structures, there is infinite possibility but no language and no way of creating any scale.

3. A tiny universe with huge possibilities. You don’t need to be or do everything. First, narrow down the possibilities to create a tiny universe with huge possibilities.

4. What is normal changes. We use windows to hide variation in what is normal. Every “norm” is temporary, or might be.

5. Noise becomes music. What is noise to one group is interesting to another and, given a bit of attention becomes music to yet another group. This happens in everything from music to devices. The trinkets and toys of weekend nerds somehow become nearly viable and then, out of nowhere, inevitable. The lesson is to listen to the noise.

6. What is normal doesn’t come from the crowd. We interpret much of history in terms of the winners, the majority and the successes - i.e. what’s liked by the crowd, what’s normal. But this “normal” never starts with the whole crowd. But what's normal now probably didn't start in the crowd - it probably started with crazy tinkering. The future probably isn't in the crowd.

## PART 2: FLOWS AND NETWORKS

1. Flows of value (not necessarily money). Everything should be understood in terms of flows of value before it’s understood in terms of money. Disruption is simply changes in flow. Most people don’t look for the flows in value they look for flows in money.

2. Networks have to start somewhere. Networks create value but we only are only aware of the end result - the networks we use every day. Starting a network is extremely hard, but shouldn’t be ignored. Networks will trump almost all other flows of value.

3. The funding model will change. The person who pays will change and the priorities will change. The value will need to change with it. The artefact might look the same, but because the funding model changes, the nature of the value changes with it.

4. Rates of change matter. Things don’t change as often or as rarely as you think. As the flows, networks and funding change it’s easy to focus on the short term rates of change but there are always many strata of change. 

## PART 3: THE MEDIUM

1. You are not your medium. Every industry over-identifies with the specific artefact it makes, to the extent that it creates identity and culture which defines the value as the medium. Then something happens, as it always does and the medium changes. 

2. The new medium is never a copy of the old. Each medium is better and worse than what came before, but it's never a copy. The mistake is carrying over your ideas of value, economics and business into the new.

3. The format of the new medium emerges. Film was not just theatre on screen. Streaming music is not just CDs on demand. The format of each medium affects what the value can and (economically) music be. This happens across every medium and every industry.

4. The value you can capture changes. New technology doesn't mean making things more efficient - tapes were not more efficient records, they increased the available listening time.

## PART 4: HEROS

1. Survivor bias. You only know about the winners which means you don't know if you're behaving like a loser.

Example (of the not-survivor bias): The Lost Flute, Tcherepnin
I can't find a recording of it. And it pre-dates "His Symphony No. 1 (1927) is remarkable for including the first symphonic movement ever written completely for unpitched percussion; this preceded by four years Edgard Varèse's Ionisation of 1931"

2. There isn’t necessarily a canon or grand narrative. If you only know about the winners, and the winners stole from the losers then you are missing a huge chunk of history. Most of what most of us do is that bit.

3. Superstar economics; normal disruption vs exponential distribution. We think success is distributed normally, but it's not and this makes us confused about why one things succeeds and another fails.

4. Short term and long term performance don’t correlate. The heros of the short term won't necessarily carry over into the long. The big names will eventually shrink. 

5. It takes someone doing something stupid. Normality evolves out of something ignored or actively hated. Someone has to be doing something stupid to change the future. Otherwise it's not the future, it's just more of now.

## PART 5: WHAT IS THIS?

1. Being right matters much less than doing. You can write the perfect thesis about how the world works but all it takes is one person doing things differently to throw all that out.

(I am very aware of the hypocracy of this one!)

2. Discussion of the industry is part of the industry. Commentary helps society absorb each artefact into itself - criticism, fan writing, commenting, sharing are all partof the machine.

(I am also aware that this contracts the previous one...)

3. Newness and originality isn’t as important as we say. We walk about newness, but radically new and radically original aren't that attractive.

4. You only live in the market you live in. We can imagine a world where the parameters are different - where the instrumentation, the styles, the tuning are all different. Pitching to an imaginary market might not work.

## PART 6: CREATING

1. All value is created from nothing. Most of our activity is spent turning things of value into new things of different value - selling a product that exists, building a shop to sell something, shipping things around the world, managing an industry which is well understood. But all this came from somewhere. We forget about creating value out of nothing.

2. Creating value doesn’t start with creating value. Inventing and creating doesn't look like normal work. You have to play, sketch, make mistakes. Watch any composer or musician in the early stages of creation and they look like a child. Fun, playful, throwaway. This is important work.

3. Creating requires sketching and practice. Almost nobody practices. We all rush to work - to look busy doing our jobs. But creating doesn't start with doing the job, it starts with sketching and practice.

4. Success is manufactured luck. There is no repeatable recipe for creating the right thing. Sometimes the thing we create lands and sometimes it doesn't. The trick is building the muscle and habbit of creation - manufacture the luck that the output hits the world at the right time.

## PART 7: VALUE

1. Important details can become unimportant overnight. Industries obsess over details long after they don't matter, chasing ever higher quality when the world has moved on. Obsession over the fine details of counterpoint may not be the detail that the world today values. And the details the world values today will shift tomorrow. This is true in the art, the industry and the consumption.

2. Artistry will be sidelined. We talk about the skill and value in music, but in truth there are diminishing returns which are sidelined by the ability to network and distribute. Artistry is important to the world but, perhaps sadly, only up to a point.

3. How do you measure value? This isn't at all clear. Popularity? But exponential distribution means that what's big gets bigger. Longevity? But what has traction will continue, and what has no traction now may transform the world very soon. Is it the number of compositions? Or the impact of those (yet many influences aren't tracable). How you think think about value determines how you view the world's work and your own.

4. Artefacts become identity, rather than the underlying value. Whether it's the instrument, the style of music or the physical media - we will create identity around the artefacts we make. But those artefacts are a coincidence of time, not something eternal. The danger is when we rail against the change in artefact. Every industry at some point over-identifies with the artefact instead of the underlying value

## PART 8: TRANSIENT

1. Everything is waves. We see the world as fixed - fixed objects, institutions, countries. Behind everything, though, there is a wave which led to the thing existing or a vibration which keeps it alive. Everythign is waves, nothing is static. Even the presence of a cloud suggests a wave of pressure which is invisible. Seeing the world like this, we start seeing out the early vibrations or early parts of the waves rather than the obvious, loud waves. We need to seek out the invisible.

2. Everything is transient. Every wave ends. Every trend, technology or idea has it's origin, it's peak and it's end. But that's half the fun - riding the wave, seeing where it goes, trying to see how far you can push it or how much fun it can be.

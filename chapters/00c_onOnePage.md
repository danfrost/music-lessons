# Music Lessons - on one page

Music is a strange microcosm of everything human: transient, cultural, technological, emotional, organised, chaotic. The turn of this century saw the industry we think of as music utterly disrupted, all but destroyed. While there are obvious lessons, it turns out that if you dig deeper you find far more lessons.

We learn that how we frame something's history dictates how we see its future. Normal is both not average and not static. The flow of value changes over time, but not simply to a new version of an old thing - sometimes new types of value emerge. How you think about value determines whether you see progress or decline. But, regardless of your view, things keep changing.

I could have written this about many industries from food to commodities, fashion t art, literature to sports. My reason for using music as a lense through which to view disruption, innovation and change is because I graduated in music around the time the internet started eating away at the music industry. This led me to research the economic history of music, which has led me back here - to reflect on how the disruptions, choas, unfairness, destruction and creation are all normal, mundane and somewhat poetic. And that the ideas from this industry might help us think about other industries.

Why does this matter?

We are living at a time when we need more, different, bigger and better ideas. We have achieved a lot through industrialisation, capitalism, communications and all the associated progress but we are, at the same time, awash with an endless supply of pointless industries and activities. Social media connected us but then they sold our attention. Our political life is spent discussing, not the nuance of an idea or how to progress it but some vague, partisan or personality issue which hardly makes an dent in the problems we ought to be solving. We have entire industries designed to trick people into parting with their money for things which will bring no long term value to humanity, solve no problems and arguably will just reinforce the shallow, cultural deadends.

Despite nearly 30 years of information technology progress, we spend a gigantic portion of our time copying and pasting information from one system we hate into another. Our productivity may not have improved according to pre-internet measures [get/check these], so perhaps the productivity is buried in new forms such as our ability to create and share information for free and instantly? Maybe, but we all know of the huge increase in noise and nonsense these technologies have created.

How do we get out of the societal and commercial rut? Where do we look for ideas which will make us see what systems we are wallowing in? How can we think really differently rather than just copying the thinking of whichever hero of commerce is on the cover of whichever magazine we happen to be leafing through?

Everything new requires fusing together material from multiple places. From photosynthesis, which fuses [photons and ??] to create…, to [find another example], the fundamental activity of creativity is bringing unlikely ideas together. All breakthroughs in human activity require fusing ideas together to create something new. 

What I bring is exactly that: a fusing of unlikely ideas in a way which, I hope, sparks some new ways of looking at the rut we're in. My offering is an unusual study of music, in which I personally find huge richness of ideas.

This is not, though, an endless sycophantic blurb about my top 10 western male composers. This is part of the problem - even the way we tend to study the history of music is typical of the way we approach ideas. We think of it as a narrow frame of reference.

I am also not going to put any artist, style, school of thought or movement on a pedestal as this takes us down a dangerous alley of thought which ends either in confirmation bias, praising of geniuses or giving up. I am also not going to present you with biographies of famous composers, because you will only end up looking for the same lessons - confirmation bias of what you want to hear.

Instead, we can use music, this peculiar human phenomenon around which we have built various cultures and industries, as a microcosm to understand how to see ourselves as humans; how to see ourselves before, during and after major change; and how to get out of the mental models which lock us in.

Studying music in this way is also timely. Music, in a way, set the scene for our century.

The disruption of music come at the start of a century which promises yet more disruption, be it through changes of geopolitical power, migration spurred by climate, war or the hope of a better life; or through technological change, financial shifts in power or financial innovations which may untie us from institutions or tie us to them in stronger ways.

Napster's disruption of the music industry was strangely prescient, demonstrating what happens when an industry and a culture think that they understand their value.

How might this help the bigger problems?

We humans are too easily locked into ways of thinking through language, culture and convention. We forget that everything around us which was created by a human was created by a human like us. We have a hierarchical idea of human creativity where those who make are at the top and those who consume are underneath and must follow. We need to think better of ourselves.

If we are going to make the big leaps in industry, politics, culture and any other area, we need to be able to identify what of the current world is real, what is made up by humans, how to identify different ways of seeing things/thinking about things and where the new ideas come from.

There is a problem, though. A reason why you'll think this is all utter nonsense.

In professional life we are too grown up. Too sensible. Too professional. We narrow what we talk about, ruling out anything which isn’t part of the business or the culture. There is work and there is play. There is learning, which is where someone else intructs you and then there is doing, which you can get paid for.

What nonsense. All human progression is made through a confusing, sometimes unhealthy mix of what we are taught combined with rambling walks through mistakes, disasters, sketching, playing and, sometimes progress. Playful does not mean wasteful - it means observing an idea and seeing what emerges. Playful is looking at something you notice every day and wondering if there's something new about it.

For many serious professionals, this book would be better left on the bookshelf. Walk away. Bank to the job (which someone else invented). Stick to what the world knows. Don't suspend disbelief. Everything is fine.

If you aren't a serious professional (and I hope you're not), let's play with some trivial ideas. It’s these trivialities where new ideas are found. We need a fresh injection of ideas all the time otherwise we become stale and pointless. These ideas do not come from your favourite business networking site or business magazine, but unlikely places. By definition, they have to to.

So my other reason for writing this is to break the patterns of thinking, introduce a new and potentially confusing idea. 

These ideas have lived almost exclusively in my notebooks for years only to come out when I'm trying to solve a particular strategy problem or understand why something in the world has happened. As with so many ideas, either there is something useful there or they are the ravings and scribblings of someone who has spent too long with their own thoughts. I leave that judgement to you.

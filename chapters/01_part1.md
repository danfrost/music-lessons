# PART 1: WINDOWS & STRUCTURES

## Windows hide the truth.

We narrow our field of view either by time, geography or some other factor to suit the judgement we want. 

We put windows around things to make them easier to explain. We create categories, labels, subset. Anything to avoid the complexity of the overall picture.

It’s natural to tidy things up - Framing is part of painting, film making. The act of editing seems to be innately human. We take out, add in and tweak until we can stand back and see the message we wanted to get across. Until the truth has been made neat. It’s almost inescapable, because as soon as you point to something and say “that’s art”, you’ve created a frame or a window through which we view. The same is true whenever a category or label is used. We define terms and in the act of defining we narrow the window of what is relevant.

In doing all this we create a window around what we deem important, we exclude what is not important. And we hide distracting parts of the truth.

Sometimes this makes sense - if we want to talk about disadvantaged people and how we’re going to help them, we need to define who they are; if we’re going to create budgets to invest in the future, we need to define how much and where we’ll invest. If we're want to understand how the poor are affected by a disease, we need to define poor, desease and what effects we're looking for.

But sometimes the windows we draw around something just serve to hide irritating details.

We create windows not just in time but also space and whatever other axis helps make our case or simplify the situation.

Read many music tuition books from the early 1900s and they talk about the canon of musical composers (the famous ones - you will know who they are) as though nothing happened outside Western Europe. Music is the canon of composers and outside of this, it was just some folk music or something - nothing worth recording. Except folk music and activity away from the canon is where the canon came from; you cannot leap straight into high art without the history of a million failed compositions and composers.

Before distinguished composers identified these folk tunes, they were ephemeral and of less value. Once captured, refined and put into a proper form they give us something to discuss. It is now “real”. We have drawn a window around what matters and everything outside of that does not.

*A window around the industry*

Windows tell us why the music industry is a shadow of its former self. Gone are the days of raking in money from CD, DVD and licensing. Gone is the control of the IP and the money. Earning money in music is harder than it has ever been, what with the rise of the internet, streaming and various platforms which facilitate direct artist and audience interaction.

Everything has got worse.

Except that the window we are drawing starts around [Statute_of_Anne,. 1710](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Anne,. 1710). Before this, there was no legal way of protecting rights of copying a creation. Like all laws, they are a function of their time and of the technological innovations which (usually recently) precede them, but they are not axiomatic. Copyright is not a physical law, it is a human law which was invented to create an industry.

Before copyright existed, the value in music was less. There was no technological way of capturing something (be it a score or recording) and distributing it, but there was also no legal way. When the printing press implied a new market of publishing, this was protected in law but that law relied on the physics of printing making it hard for anyone to setup as a printer. They wanted to incentivise innovation and commerce.

But when the physics of publishing was broken by the internet, all of the assumptions around what needed to be protected had to change. It wasn’t that the internet broke or disrupted the music industry, it’s that the underlying assumptions were no longer sound.

Open up the window of the music industry’s history and you realise that the industry has not suffered a huge blow to its fundamental rights, it’s just that a new wave of technology has challenged the idea that copyright might be the way to encourage a particular activity. 

Copyright law is an example of how we layer up human activity based on assumptions which are neither universal nor eternal. You can create copyright law, but that doesn’t mean the assumptions will hold forever and in all places. There is also no point in writing down your assumptions because you’re only aware of what you’re aware of, and something which is axiomatic may change overnight.

_TASK: Create this chart_

What does thinking about this Window effect tell us?

If we created a chart of the cost of capturing and distributing music value (e.g. by sheet music) over time, we would see that the IP law and the rise of print enabled this.

But if you open the window wider, there was no way of capturing economic value at that scale. No way in law or in technology. The music industry before these inventions and laws was simply not possible before this.

The value was entirely human made and so it can be human un-made.

Yes, the technology and the law were all about providing some industrial printing houses with the incentive to operate at scale since this creates a business. If you protect their interests, you create an industry. 

The internet took almost every part of the creation and distribution of music and made the physical distribution costs almost zero. The IP law reflects nothing about the technological or physical world anymore. For how long can the IP laws be divorced from the physics of the situation? [Add an example to show how law & physics can’t be totally divorced forever.]

By opening the window slightly further into the past, we see that what is normal did not always exist. We now need to think about what might appear as we open the window to the right, into the future.

Will we build a new ”physics”, in which copying is hard again? Or is this it? Are we 20 years into a century where the sale of recorded music makes no physical sense?

The specific answer doesn’t matter as much as knowing that there will be an answer but it won’t be based on the narrow window which makes us feel safe.

_Practical lessons_

1. Be aware of the “window” you using to understand a problem. This may be you focusing on the problem but equally it might be you ignoring complexity.

2. What happens if you slide the window left or right? - e.g. if you open up times before or after? When the x-axis of the window is time, this usually means you are creeping into times before an industry existed in the form it exists now. Understanding humans solved the same problem before an industry can give a better idea of whether this industry is here forever or if it is simply evolving.

3. Be aware of the window everyone else is using. Most people aren’t aware of what they are ignoring - they can’t see their industry beyond set of inputs and outputs it is right now. If you can see beyond that, you can find new ways of imagining the industry.


## Structures create value.

Without structures, there is infinite possibility but no language and no way of creating any scale.

--

In our minds now, the music industry is the IP industry. We may go to concerts, buy merchandise or watch their youtube videos but for us (or at least for a certain generation) music equals IP, and does so because we assume that musicians get paid for the tracks they released even if the journey to that music is circuitous.

This structure - of IP, and of everything which hangs off it - has created a valuable industry. This reinforces the idea in our mind that music is IP.

IP is a structure because it takes something invisible, ephemeral and public and assigns a creator, an owner and a customer. It has allowed publishers to be created out of thin air to capture the music of composers through the efforts of performers into the technology of engineers and exchange these artefacts of recorded music for cash from an audience. (Who, we learn elsewhere, had to be taught to but the music.)

Many commentators have and still do criticise this commodification of music. This may be true, but in a sense it doesn’t matter. If it has been commodified this has also allowed the creation of an industry around (if not of) creativity which otherwise didn’t and couldn’t exist at all.

The structure that IP created - creator, owner, customer - has enabled huge amounts of value.

Structure like this matters. We see this in the creator economy we are living through. The platforms have made a structure where a creator creates value (content) which is distributed by the platform to an audience. Without this structure, there is simply no audience or economic value.

Structures matter because they give people roles. While many people did try to be creators before such platforms existed, without the idea of roles people have to sell the idea of something else. Imagine a world without physical theatres where an actor wants to attract an audience. You cannot invite people to the theatre because there is no such thing. If nobody understands what a theatre is, they will resort to creating something else - a tavern, a church, a party. Eventually the world learns what a theatre is, but that’s not how it starts.

When the idea (e.g. of theatre) exists, roles start to emerge. The audience know their role. The actor knows theirs.

And once these roles exist, the roles create a space for people and companies to carve out a niche and excel. Quickly, we have the best actor, the most romantic actor. We know about the classical theatre, the up-and-coming theatre.

In music IP, it allowed labels to create genres, record shops, festivals and a plethora of ideas which all stemmed from the structure that IP gave.

These structures, like IP, exist everywhere there is value. Every part of human life (certainly every part of economic life) depends on some kind of structure, otherwise we cannot operate the scale which economic success depends.

..

When these structures exist for a while, they become nearly invisible and taken for granted. You probably only thought of the link between IP and music because I mentioned it. And perhaps the same is true of the role of content platforms.

..

Without realising that the structures are there, we miss out on two opportunities. The first is to exploit the structure - to know what the game is. When people complain about not being able to make it in music or any other industry, but the structure is fundamentally one of superstars and celebrity, they are complaining about something which is not going to change. (What I term a “gravity problem”; you can complain about gravity but see where that gets you.)

The second opportunity is to be ready for when the structure changes. The industry of music hasn’t always been IP based on the mechanical copying of music works, so there is no reason to believe that this is how the future for music will pan out.

As far as I can tell, almost nobody is aware of the underlying structures which enable their own industry. In anything from financial through education to music, arts or sport. People seem to go into industries and believe that this is how it has always been and this is how it will always be. Even the rebels believe some fundamental right to the economics of the industry they went into [get an example of a rock group objecting to the internet and streaming]. if they are aware of the structures, they think that the structures were formed at the time of the big bang and will outlast all of humanity. 

Naively believing that the structures have been and will be there forever is fine, most people do it. But in recognising that this is not the case you open yourself up to exploring what your industry might evolve into.

The composer writing with pencil on manuscript paper is not taking part in music, they are just creating an artefact of music which emerged in the 2nd millennium AD (CE??) in order to transmit instructions. This is no more creating music than is clicking a mouse around a computer screen; it is just the current structure we work with. It will all change.

When the structure changes, people will cling to their roles in the old structure. They will object saying that all of the value is being taken away - we are ruining our culture. 

And it also teaches us to identify when the structures might change. This, really, is all there is to understanding potential disruption. If you can identify the structures on which an industry runs and you can identify if those are cultural/conventional, legal/political or physical then you will understand the real risks to the industry.
Most people in most industries don’t do this because the structures are invisible. Every content industry assumed the value was in the content, until content becomes cheap to distribute.

## A tiny universe with huge possibilities.

You don’t need to be or do everything. First, narrow down the possibilities to create a tiny universe with huge possibilities.

## What is normal changes.

We use windows to hide variation in what is normal. Every “norm” is temporary, or might be.

## Noise becomes music.

#4 means that what is noise today becomes music tomorrow.

## What is normal doesn’t come from the crowd.

We interpret much of history in terms of the winners, the majority and the successes - i.e. what’s liked by the crowd, what’s normal. But this “normal” never starts with the whole crowd.

## PART 1: WINDOWS & STRUCTURES

### Part 1.1  - Windows hide the truth

Questions I have (to share on social):
[ ] What are systematic ways we have of controlling / changing the truth?
[ ] What myths are true in the short term but wrong in the long term?
[ ] What systems (industries) feel eternal / fundamental but aren't that old?

*See links from this*
    > Data dredging (also known as data snooping or p-hacking)[1][a] is the misuse of data analysis to find patterns in data that can be presented as statistically significant, thus dramatically increasing and understating the risk of false positives. This is done by performing many statistical tests on the data and only reporting those that come back with significant results.

E.g.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nations_and_IQ
    > Susan Barnett and Wendy Williams characterized IQ and the Wealth of Nations as "an edifice built on layer upon layer of arbitrary assumptions and selective data manipulation. The data on which the entire book is based are of questionable validity and are used in ways that cannot be justified."[9]
    See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_and_the_Wealth_of_Nations

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_abstraction
*IS "window"ing a form of selective abstraction? (Maybe this is a bit of a leap?)
    > In clinical psychology, selective abstraction is a type of cognitive bias or cognitive distortion in which a detail is taken out of context and believed whilst everything else in the context is ignored.[1] It commonly appears in Aaron T. Beck's work in cognitive therapy. Another definition is: "focusing on only the negative aspects of an event, such as, 'I ruined the whole recital because of that one mistake'".[2]



Find the example of how Russia has a different way of thinking about history. (Podcast??)


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_omission
    > Selective omission is a memory bias. In collective memory, it is a bias where a group (state, media, public opinion) works to forget traumatic memories.
    > 
    > This expression is often used for post-war rewriting of history in a more coherent way according to local stereotypes and moral values,[1] which may include denying war atrocities.
^ Look at this more. Is this too much of a stretch? 
what evidence is there that industries do this - that they selectively ommit parts 
of their history (... which may mean they don't fully understand themselves.) ??

    Subjectivity in History
    Learn what subjective history is. Identify the conflicts between objectivity and bias in history, and discover the importance of subjectivity in history.

The saying "history is written by the victors" is relevant to this.

But perhaps, _the industry is defined by the interests of the incumbents_ is also true.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_stereotype
Is this relevant?

Ben Evan's writing on defining industries is relevant here.

^ this seems like a pretty typical history of music - find some more official exampels of this:

    During the 20th Century music became big business, but the 21st Century may lead us back to an older mode of existence for artists.

    In the 1700s and 1800s, music was largely funded by the state, the church, and wealthy private patrons, or was simply played in the home by amateurs. In the mid-1800s however there became some opportunities to “mass market” music. A song could become a “hit” if it was part of a successful operetta (the Merry Widow was famous for its successful merchandising efforts) or if a well-known, touring minstrel or, later, vaudeville performer performed the song repeatedly across the country. (Al Jolson famously insisted on including his name as a co-writer on songs he had nothing to do with writing so that he would receive royalties in exchange for making a song famous.) Publishers were able to sell thousands and thousands of copies sheet music to the musically literate public of “hit songs” to be played at home on their pianos. The constant production of new songs that could capture the public’s attention became a booming model for publishers and songwriters.

    "For a long time, the music industry has relied predominantly on traditional record labels."
^ This is true and the author is making a particular point, but it's windowing.

Windowing is probably influenced/created by survivor bias "which is concentrating on the people or things that "survived" some process and inadvertently overlooking those that did not because of their lack of visibility." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Availability_heuristic). Because we work with what we have.

Salience bias, the tendency to focus on items that are more prominent or emotionally striking and ignore those that are unremarkable, even though this difference is often irrelevant by objective standards. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Availability_heuristic)
Is this what's happening?

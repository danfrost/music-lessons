## Flows of value (not necessarily money).

Everything should be understood in terms of flows of value before it’s understood in terms of money. Disruption is simply changes in flow. Most people don’t look for the flows in value they look for flows in money.

Everything is flows of value
Some flows of value are huge - e.g. banks being able to take deposits and turn them into loans; fractional reserve banking. Create a flow-map of this (like the Google Analytics conversion map). Many flows of value will be small or dwindling. 
If you see a river or stream, you can see the physical flow of value - of water. But economic and value flows are harder to see. 
It’s also hard to see early stage flows of value. The discussion of cryptocurrencies on forums in the 90s and early 2000s was a torrent of high value, but it had not yet turned into high economic value. 


## Networks have to start somewhere.

Networks create value but we only are only aware of the end result - the networks we use every day. Starting a network is extremely hard, but shouldn’t be ignored. Networks will trump almost all other flows of value.

Churches
Records
… the network compounds

E.g. village churches (plague)

MySpace

Creating a network is extremely difficult. 
AirBnB
PayPal 
Etc.
Many networks fail but we don’t know about those. Many people have the idea of a network but what they describe is the end state - an ecosystem of players who all get value from this wonderful network. Many people will say this in response to the news - why don’t we just do “x”. However, creating a network of high value requires a series of lower value networks. 
You need to bootstrap - this doesn’t mean be cheapskate. 

## The funding model will change.

The person who pays will change and the priorities will change. The value will need to change with it. The artefact might look the same, but because the funding model changes, the nature of the value changes with it.

Beethoven was the first freelance composer. (Actually, he’s the first we have records for but this is good enough for now.)

Before this, in western classical music it was normal for music to be funded through the church or patrons. As the political and financial situation evolved, the money shifted from these places to new places.

It doesn’t really matter where it moved from and to because the lesson is clear: the funding model will change.

In the past 20 years the way in which musical careers are funded has changed. People pay for digital copies or short term loans of a recording (i.e. a stream) rather than physical copies. 

The streaming model has put the control in the hands of streaming platforms. So the money has shifted and so has the power.

Platforms like YouTube and TikTok provide a completely different way to monetise music. The classic disruption here is that can you imagine a world in which your local record store would build a website to share music videos for free rather than sell records? The skills are completely different, but this shift has happened.

Just as flows of value change, networks change so does the funding model. The change of funding model matters more because it’s noticed (musicians complain that they can’t sell CDs at gigs) and has a more direct impact on where you go to sell your skills. If the people which used to pay for your skills don’t have the money they had, the might not buy anymore.

We have seen many shifts in funding power: churches, royal patrons, print publishers, music publishers.

It’s also not a given that the people with all the resources will win. Companies existed before the iPod which had music catalogue, hardware capabilities and distribution [Sony - check]. You don’t need much more to win, but they didn’t. So the network and flows of value shifted, making the funding model shift. These kinds of shifts, where a new entrant creates a new flow of value, new networks and new funding models are all the more impactful because the new entrant has no reason to respect any old constraints.

Our model now is based on attention, streaming, audience. In part it’s still based on IP but in truth there are no holy cows - any cow may be slaughtered. In the future, there is no reason why the funding model won’t completely change. Again.

## Rates of change matter.

Things don’t change as often or as rarely as you think. As the flows, networks and funding change it’s easy to focus on the short term rates of change but there are always many strata of change. 

--

Everything happens over night after it’s taken decades to happen at all.

The rate at which things change matter because they constrain what can change and, in the end, what will change. These rates of change are based on the flows of value, incumbent networks and interests. 

It takes much longer to create a new network of concert halls, which might take years than it takes to create a new trend/style of music, which may happen every year. Some rates of change are based on hardware networks like concert halls, travel routes or the training of humans to perform musical works. Other rates of change are based on individual or group taste.

Still other rates of change become so deeply baked into our culture and education that we don’t realise they might change. We have 12 notes in a scale for no good reason other than we do, but changing this will probably take decades (although it’s already started in some circles so perhaps it’s going to happen).

Distribution channels, the very unglamorous side of the music business which deals with shipping physical goods or arranging royalty contracts are setup by business people who want to plan months or years into the future. Some IP contracts imply a steady state for decades to come.

Then there are musical trends themselves, the part which probably makes all that business planning certainty far more risky. Musical trends are manifest in the behaviour of the audience; if people learn to like something they will buy it. But people can quickly learn to like something else and, depending on their age they may switch to a new trend on a new platform using a new format seemly overnight.

These rates of change, where the fickle consumer simply changes their mind but at the same time as millions of other is what makes rates of change so important. 

We need to be aware of both the slow rates of change and the fast. It’s easy to look at just a fast rate of change and assume that everything will suddenly change, but it’s also easy to look at slower rates and say it’ll never change.

In reality, all the rates of change are important.

And lastly, some rates of change depend on people leaving the market either through retirement or death.

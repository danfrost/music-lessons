# PART 3: THE MEDIUM

## You are not your medium. 
This has to be the most dangerous misunderstanding of all. It taps into everything which is wrong with people: our ego; overly focusing on what we already know instead of learning.

You - and your company and your industry - are not the medium you happen to work in. The value that people truly get from you may come from a piano keyboard, plucked strings. It might come from giving them records or CDs. It might come from performing gigs for them. But all of those are a medium which forces you to make a specific artefact.

The entire music industry assumed that the sale of physical media was its purpose. This infested not just the thinking of top executives but also the music consuming public. We took it as read that buying music was about browsing, feeling the records in our hand and seeing the sleeve notes and art. These are all artefacts of a specific medium which are important for that medium but they are not the purpose of music.

When streaming appeared, it was (as these things always are) worse than what it suggested it would replace. Lower quality, smaller catalogue, dodgy legality and confusing ownership rules. When a lower quality medium appears it is always judged with the value of the old medium. This is true of the technological medium as well as styles of music, social events which occur around the music. Humans will judge using the judgements they have to hand.

The medium is, so often, an experimental toy used by a few enthusiasts for purposes which confuse (or infuriate) the old medium’s elite and the masses. But for these tinkerers, none of this judgement matters. But the new medium is beyond judgement.

Inside the new medium, the values are different. If the new medium is just one of choice, like the choice between performing in a tavern or a concern hall then the values don’t matter. But if the medium becomes a de facto standard the values matter, like when music moves from concert halls to recordings. When this shift happens, the musicians (and companies) who succeed work with the medium, not against it.

But for many, this doesn’t happen. They cling to the old values citing things like craftsmanship, years of experience, expertise, their qualifications and on and on. All of these matter, but only in the old medium.

This happens for the individual, the group, the company and the industry. Legal fights over ownership eat away attention and energy while new companies simply build a totally new form of value. You cannot sue your way into the future. The law only protects the medium and the value that we understand.

You are not your medium. Whatever skills, medium, format you work in today is a coincidence of history and nothing more. There is no universal truth which means this is how it will always be. But, for any industry it exists because of some underlying value; some human motivation. Even if the specific medium fades, the underlying value will be provided by a new medium.

The question for you is whether you have tied your ego and your attention too closely to one medium rather than the underlying value.


***ADD: Groupthink fits in here. the group over-identifies with the medium.


## The new medium is never a copy of the old.

The nuances of a new medium are not a copy of the old. Thinking and acting as though this is the case means you miss out on new value, new ways of delighting people or just miss the point of the new medium altogether.

Films are not just recorded theatre. We didn’t learn this right away - we had to great a “grammar” of film. 

Photography is not just a quick form of painting of drawing. We didn’t learn this, to the extent that paintings made from early photos copied them like for like instead of [editing?] reality for artistic purposes. [explain better]

CDs were not just higher quality records - the audio balance on them is fundamentally different, and they lent themselves to better use in cars and easier copying. Whatever you think of this, the new medium here has materially impacted how the underlying value (the sound and the emotion) can be used.

The shift from one medium to another is usually a bit rocky. Early films were like recorded theatre. Early recordings were recorded performances. It takes time to evolve a grammar of a new medium. The early web talked introduced “web pages” but a web page differs in almost every way from a physical “page”, but the name has stuck.

So the new is different from the old. Why does this matter?

For anyone working in one medium when there is a shift, it’s tempting and too easy to believe that everything you know works on the new medium. Some of this may be true, but sometimes it’s embarrassingly not true. Watch certain social ads to see a total misunderstanding of newer social platforms where the fact that the platform uses video treats the platform as just about distributing video instead of a 2-way social interaction.

Online publishing is not the same as book publishing. Traditional publishers have made some inroads, but where has the real impact in the online world come from? The relationship between a musician and their audience in a streaming world is different from a CD-buying world. The musicians who succeed use the new medium for what it’s good at.

But we know all this because we talk about how [insert band name] exploited [synths, recording studios, etc etc] so well. We know that the people who succeed really get into the detail of what can be done, they play with it and find out what works and then find themselves as the forefront. 

There will be certain skills which may travel across - good copy editing might still be important, good production might matter, a sense of style (whatever that means). But there is often no fundamental reason why these things do matter. 

We see shifts in medium every few years.

## The format of the new medium emerges.

In Vienna in [XX century] publishers weren’t clear what size of book would be best for publishing music. They experimented with ….

What happened in Vienna is what happens with each new medium. The world will not simply copy things over from one medium to another. [....]

Score formats in Vienna (note the book << FIND THIS. GET EXAMPLE.)

“Format” is the specific way of using a medium. In computing, it is the type of file (mp3, wav) or the disc size (3.5 inch or Zip drive). In music, it is the length of the song, the use of the audio spectrum, how compressed the song is and any other nuances.

The 3 minute song is not neurologically or culturally hardcoded. A lot of music is longer or shorter. Our attention is not necessarily tied to this length. But through successive technological restrictions and cultural evolutions, this format has emerged. [This started with the XX wax disc…].

What then ensues is a network [LINK] of flows of value [LINK] with ever more expert knowledge in delivering this specific format of medium [LINK]. 

When a new medium emerges, the formats which follow it are not a given but are often dictated by the technological characteristics influenced by cultural.

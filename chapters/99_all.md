# PART 1: WINDOWS & STRUCTURES


## Windows hide the truth. We narrow our field of view either by time, geography or some other factor to suit the judgement we want. 

We put windows around things to make them easier to explain. We create categories, labels, subsets. Anything to avoid the complexity of the overall picture.

It’s natural to tidy things up - Framing is part of painting, film making. The act of editing seems to be innately human. We  take out, add it and tweak until we can stand back and see the message we wanted to get across. It’s almost inescapable, because as soon as you point to something and say “that’s art”, you’ve created a frame or a window through which we view. The same is true whenever a category or label is used.

Sometimes this makes sense - if we want to talk about disadvantaged people and how we’re going to help them, we need to define who they are; if we’re going to create budgets to invest in the future, we need to define how much and where we’ll invest.

But sometimes the windows we draw around something just serve to hide irritating details.

..

We create windows not just in time but also space and whatever other axis helps make our case or simplify the situation.

Read many music tuition books from the early 1900s and they talk about the canon of musical composers (the famous ones - you will know who they are) as though nothing happened outside Western Europe. Music is the canon of composers and outside of this, it was just some folk music or something - nothing worth recording. Except folk music and activity away from the canon is where the canon came from; you cannot leap straight into high art without the history of a million failed compositions and composers.

Before distinguished composers identified these folk tunes, they were ephemeral and of less value. Once captured, refined and put into a proper form they give us something to discuss. It is now “real”. We have drawn a window around what matters and everything outside of that does not.

..

Windows tell us why the music industry is a shadow of its former self. Gone are the days of raking in money from CD, DVD and licensing. Gone is the control of the IP and the money. Earning money in music is harder than it has ever been, what with the rise of the internet, streaming and various platforms which facilitate direct artist and audience interaction.

Everything has got worse.

Except that the window we are drawing starts around [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Anne,. 1710]. Before this, there was no legal way of protecting rights of copying a creation. Like all laws, they are a function of their time and of the technological innovations which (usually recently) precede them, but they are not axiomatic. Copyright is not a physical law, it is a human law which was invented to create an industry.

Before copyright existed, the value in music was less. There was no technological way of capturing something (be it a score or recording) and distributing it, but there was also no legal way. When the printing press implied a new market of publishing, this was protected in law but that law relied on the physics of printing making it hard for anyone to setup as a printer. They wanted to incentivise innovation and commerce.

But when the physics of publishing was broken by the internet, all of the assumptions around what needed to be protected had to change. It wasn’t that the internet broke or disrupted the music industry, it’s that the underlying assumptions were no longer sound.

Open up the window of the music industry’s history and you realise that the industry has not suffered a huge blow to its fundamental rights, it’s just that a new wave of technology has challenged the idea that copyright might be the way to encourage a particular activity. 

Copyright law is an example of how we layer up human activity based on assumptions which are neither universal nor eternal. You can create copyright law, but that doesn’t mean the assumptions will hold forever and in all places. There is also no point in writing down your assumptions because you’re only aware of what you’re aware of, and something which is axiomatic may change overnight.

**Create this chart>>>

What does thinking about this Window effect tell us?

If we created a chart of the cost of capturing and distributing music value (e.g. by sheet music) over time, we would see that the IP law and the rise of print enabled this.

But if you open the window wider, there was no way of capturing economic value at that scale. No way in law or in technology. The music industry before these inventions and laws was simply not possible before this.

The value was entirely human made and so it can be human un-made.

Yes, the technology and the law were all about providing some industrial printing houses with the incentive to operate at scale since this creates a business. If you protect their interests, you create an industry. 

The internet took almost every part of the creation and distribution of music and made the physical distribution costs almost zero. The IP law reflects nothing about the technological or physical world anymore. For how long can the IP laws be divorced from the physics of the situation? [Add an example to show how law & physics can’t be totally divorced forever.]

By opening the window slightly further into the past, we see that what is normal did not always exist. We now need to think about what might appear as we open the window to the right, into the future.

Will we build a new ”physics”, in which copying is hard again? Or is this it? Are we 20 years into a century where the sale of recorded music makes no physical sense?

The specific answer doesn’t matter as much as knowing that there will be an answer but it won’t be based on the narrow window which makes us feel safe.

Practical lessons

Be aware of the “window” you using to understand a problem. This may be you focusing on the problem but equally it might be you ignoring complexity.

What happens if you slide the window left or right? - e.g. if you open up times before or after? When the x-axis of the window is time, this usually means you are creeping into times before an industry existed in the form it exists now. Understanding humans solved the same problem before an industry can give a better idea of whether this industry is here forever or if it is simply evolving.

Be aware of the window everyone else is using. Most people aren’t aware of what they are ignoring - they can’t see their industry beyond set of inputs and outputs it is right now. If you can see beyond that, you can find new ways of imagining the industry.

## Structures create value.

Without structures, there is infinite possibility but no language and no way of creating any scale.

## A tiny universe with huge possibilities.

You don’t need to be or do everything. First, narrow down the possibilities to create a tiny universe with huge possibilities.

## What is normal changes.

We use windows to hide variation in what is normal. Every “norm” is temporary, or might be.

## Noise becomes music.

#4 means that what is noise today becomes music tomorrow.

## What is normal doesn’t come from the crowd.

We interpret much of history in terms of the winners, the majority and the successes - i.e. what’s liked by the crowd, what’s normal. But this “normal” never starts with the whole crowd.

# PART 2: FLOWS AND NETWORKS

## Flows of value (not necessarily money).

Everything should be understood in terms of flows of value before it’s understood in terms of money. Disruption is simply changes in flow. Most people don’t look for the flows in value they look for flows in money.

## Networks have to start somewhere.

Networks create value but we only are only aware of the end result - the networks we use every day. Starting a network is extremely hard, but shouldn’t be ignored. Networks will trump almost all other flows of value.

## The funding model will change.

The person who pays will change and the priorities will change. The value will need to change with it. The artefact might look the same, but because the funding model changes, the nature of the value changes with it.

## Rates of change matter.

Things don’t change as often or as rarely as you think. As the flows, networks and funding change it’s easy to focus on the short term rates of change but there are always many strata of change. 

# PART 3: THE MEDIUM

## You are not your medium. 

## The new medium is never a copy of the old.

## The format of the new medium emerges.

## The value you can capture changes.

# PART 4: HEROS

## Survivor bias.

## There isn’t necessarily a canon or grand narrative.

## Superstar economics; normal disruption vs exponential distribution.

## The big names will eventually shrink.

## Short term and long term performance don’t correlate.

## It takes someone doing something stupid.

# PART 5: WHAT IS THIS?

## Being right matters much less than doing.

## Discussion the industry is part of the industry.

## Newness and originality isn’t as important as we say.

## You only live in the market you live in.

# PART 6: CREATING

## All value is created from nothing.

## Creating value doesn’t start with creating value.

## Creation requires practice, sketching and creativity.

## Success is manufactured luck.

# PART 7: VALUE

## Important details can become unimportant overnight.

## Artistry will be sidelined.

## How do you measure value?

## Product can become identity.

# PART 8: TRANSIENT

## Everything is waves

## Everything is transient

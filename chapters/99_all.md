# PART 4: HEROS

## Survivor bias.

## There isn’t necessarily a canon or grand narrative.
We cannot unhear stories / grand narratives

## Superstar economics; normal disruption vs exponential distribution.
“Unfairness” compounds because it is exponentially distributed but we tend to view everything a normally distributed. Normal distribution occurs in things like height, weight… but when dealing with trends or popular things, there are other effects when mean some will become exponential.
An exponential distribution means that a small number of things will get all of the attention / money / fame. 
When one artist gets almost all the money and the fame, we think this is unfair. All that is happening is networks of people and companies gravitate to what is “going to success”, which is usually synonymous with what is popular. And so, what is popular pulls in more of what is popular creating the unfair, exponential distribution. And so it repeats; more content begets more content.
What we learn from this is:
Exponential distributions occur and are natural
A “failure” may be simply a failure to push into the top 10% rather than a total failure of the idea / product / artist

## The big names will eventually shrink.
E.g. content

## Short term and long term performance don’t correlate.
Resurgence of - 
Styles
Composers

## It takes someone doing something stupid.
Every big name is a big name for a reason.
???Not sure about this bit???


# PART 5: WHAT IS THIS?

## Being right matters much less than doing.
…because it all exists in a made up universe
We (humans) can redefine it
Same with most things - education, food, fashion, sports
All the effort we put into defining what “it” is can be undone overnight

Being right matters much less than doing
There can be diminishing returns to knowledge

## Discussion the industry is part of the industry.
Discussion is an important part of the industry
It creates and sustains interest
Aka pundits are not objective

## Newness and originality isn’t as important as we say.
Remember, we are operating in a tiny universe. Absolute newness, which uses all possible dimensions of change would be far too confusing.
On top of this, many markets operating in fluctuating difference not compounding improvement 

## You only live in the market you live in.
Complaining that things used to be better doesn’t mean anything. E.g. CDs/records/etc
Saying that things could be better doesn’t mean anything unless you’re creating it

# PART 6: CREATING

## All value is created from nothing.
Unlike what the economic textbooks say, most initial “value” is not valuable. The first coal to be mined, the first draft of a book, the first experiment…
This is true of most human activity - it has little economic value. But every now and again, the output of this activity becomes valuable. A lot of things have to be true for this to happen but this tells us two things:
We over value our existing raw materials (e.g. the musician who is already selling well) and under value other raw materials (e.g. the up and coming musician). There may be value in both.

## Creating value doesn’t start with creating value.
Economics tends to start with the idea of creating value. The worker creates another widget.
But the first widget is not the start of the widget. In the classic text, Adam Smith talks about creating pins. But the creation of the first pin didn’t start with creating a pin. It would have started with experimenting with metal or wood, or trimming a stick.
The creation of a successful music track or music career doesn’t start with creating a good track or great musician. There is a huge amount of “low value” output which must come before that.
This teaches us that:
We must value what is not yet valued
We must get on with creating it

## Creation requires practice, sketching and creativity.
This lesson hasn’t been learnt by business at all

## Success is manufactured luck.
Practice, publish, repeat

# PART 7: VALUE

## Important details can become unimportant overnight.
Audio quality
Physical sleeve notes
Etc…
Applies to any specific technical detail, e.g. tuning system

## Artistry will be sidelined.
We talk more about everything that sounds the thing than the thing itself. I have almost never had a conversation about the actual music - the notes, rhythms, specific timbres, how the compression is use to emphasise the singer’s voice. 
I.e. the artistry will be sidelined
This is: catalogue; idolising; economics; trends

## How do you measure value?
Baumol? 

## Product can become identity.
Social signalling
This is important because how can identity possibly be reflected in something as simple as the number of lines in a history book?

# PART 8: TRANSIENT

## Everything is waves
We often only see the tip of the wave. 
Clouds are just part of the wave of airflow in the atmosphere. The superstars we see, the successes and the heroes are just the clouds which reflect all the underlying activity.

The question - or the trick - is to understand where the airflows are.

## Everything is transient

This is the last lesson. The `poetic` comparison

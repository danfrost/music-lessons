# PART 2: FLOWS AND NETWORKS

## Flows of value (not necessarily money).

Everything should be understood in terms of flows of value before it’s understood in terms of money. Disruption is simply changes in flow. Most people don’t look for the flows in value they look for flows in money.

## Networks have to start somewhere.

Networks create value but we only are only aware of the end result - the networks we use every day. Starting a network is extremely hard, but shouldn’t be ignored. Networks will trump almost all other flows of value.

## The funding model will change.

The person who pays will change and the priorities will change. The value will need to change with it. The artefact might look the same, but because the funding model changes, the nature of the value changes with it.

## Rates of change matter.

Things don’t change as often or as rarely as you think. As the flows, networks and funding change it’s easy to focus on the short term rates of change but there are always many strata of change. 

# PART 3: THE MEDIUM

## You are not your medium. 

## The new medium is never a copy of the old.

## The format of the new medium emerges.

## The value you can capture changes.

# PART 4: HEROS

## Survivor bias.

## There isn’t necessarily a canon or grand narrative.

## Superstar economics; normal disruption vs exponential distribution.

## The big names will eventually shrink.

## Short term and long term performance don’t correlate.

## It takes someone doing something stupid.

# PART 5: WHAT IS THIS?

## Being right matters much less than doing.

## Discussion the industry is part of the industry.

## Newness and originality isn’t as important as we say.

## You only live in the market you live in.

# PART 6: CREATING

## All value is created from nothing.

## Creating value doesn’t start with creating value.

## Creation requires practice, sketching and creativity.

## Success is manufactured luck.

# PART 7: VALUE

## Important details can become unimportant overnight.

## Artistry will be sidelined.

## How do you measure value?

## Product can become identity.

# PART 8: TRANSIENT

## Everything is waves

## Everything is transient

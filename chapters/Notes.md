***Identity is a core part of disruption*** Don't lose this.




## this is _nth order effect_ - put this somehwere


If we return to the areas which interested about AI, we remember that this wasn't about the underlying technology which is simply an enabler of what gets done with the technology. Our interest is in the effects - in what happens and how that impacts various areas of life.

How are we measuring the progress of computing? One way is to talk about the number of calculations which can be performed each second. ((Add a chart)) This reduces life down to just that - calculations. This is interesting, but is merely a proxy for the impact of computing. What about how computers compete with humans on difficult tasks? This is interesting because it gives us a sense of how this new creature of AI-enabled-computing compares to us, and it seems a very human thing to do to judge something new in terms of what we know.

Those are all 1st-order effects. A 1st order effect is what happens as a result of an action. I push the first domino over and it falls over; I push the glass over and the glass falls over. 1st order effects in technology are the remit of the engineer, but they don't really help us think about how the world as a whole will change.

More intersting are the 2nd and 3rd order effects. In truth, thinking beyond this is a series of "if this... and if that... and if the other thing... then X will be true" statements. We string together endless possibilities and only some are going to happen. But it is those 2nd, 3rd... nth order effects which is what makes the real difference.

The internet enabled communication of arbitrary information at global scale. That's the 1st order effect. The nth order effect is that governments were able to interfere in elections by manipulating how society communicated on new platforms built on top of the internet; and that I can commission work on research, production and promotion with a team around the world without meeting any of them or worrying about physical contracts.

Computing is the most obvious case of industry disruption and we could fill a book with endless examples. however, there's no point restating at length the world we live in. What's interesting is to think about what areas of life are about to be eaten by computing and AI. Will it be everything or just a few areas? When an area is replaced with computing and AI, what will the 2nd and 3rd order effects be.

As we enter an ago of content generation, where machines can create content which was previously the role of humans we will see a series of nth-order effects but all we have now are questions: what happens when machines can generate infintie amounts of good quality music? What happens when machines can both generate music and measure of heart-rate / brain activity to calm you? What happens when machines can summarise statistics better than humans (which they can already do)? A lot of this capability is here already, we just haven't seen the effects.

If we go back to two much older technologies, the mechanical clock and the train, we can see an interesting series of nth order impacts. Trains needed train timetables, so clocks became more widespread. This meant that time became more centrally managed - anything related to the trains had to abide by the timing of the trains.

((Find some research on this - some case studies e.g. of how towns changed to have clocks in the middle.))

What are the equivalents going to be in AI? Maybe that's not the right question - that's asking for a specific set of predictions. Maybe we need to think about how to breakdown the problem, so the question becomes: how can we think about the impact of new forms of AI (without endlessly speculating what the specific impacts will be)?

The questions we take into how we explore music as lens for understanding disruption are: 
How do we understand the nth degree implications of something?

## Add this to _identity_ (over identifying)


This attacking of our identity happens in other industries. If we take Music as our lens, there are dozens of examples. This AI-generated music doesn't sound good enough because it doesn't come from a human. Then a few years later, it does sound good enough so we shift the goal posts. [Get some refs/evidence.]

If we stick with music but move out of AI: streaming is not the real way to consume music, you should buy physical records. Except an entire generation is streaming music and loving it - whatever they are missing out on, they have built an entire culture around this new format.

Let's make it less about technology. This blues/jazz/rock and roll music is not american [find a quote]... therefore it challenges our identity.

Again, how do we measure the improvement in calculation?
GFLOPS
£s/GFLOPS
(£s/GFLOPS) / average page (to give a sense of how much cheaper than a human the computer system is?)

XXREMOVE Or do we measure the impact on the things it replaces? E.g. we don't have typing pools anymore.

Which leads to a constructive set of questions: how can you identify the flows of values which you think are axiomatic and will never change? How can you explore where new flows of value might be occur? And what will they do to your involvement in the value?

## Future:

AI content creation - writing, art. (There will also be music.)
This questions what it means to be a human, but that question is directly related to questions like "what does it mean to listen to music".

### *Education*

Community
(Get a bit of history on this)
Industrial

The purpose of education. This means that the important value the world finds in education shifts. What we see in education (like a lot of slower moving industries) is a dogma which persists long after the shift in underlying desired value has happened. People want something new from education but education (the industry) doesn't understand what this is.

Education is also subject to non-disruptable limits: the key point of education is to alter the brains of humans. If there are physical/biological limits to this, those will dictate the possible rate of change.

### *Shipping / trade*

Changes in trade routes - as new value is discovered. 

In a way, shipping might be a better way of viewing disruption because it's physical. For our purposes, we can see all human endevour as some form of arbitrage and creation - finding value in one place, adding something to it and selling it for more value elsewhere.

### *Companies which have been disrupted*

_Look into each of these_

Pan Am
Borders
Pets.com
Tower Records
General motors
Kodak


### *High street*

Travel agents (vs AirBnB)
High st shops (get stats on the shift and see how much is / has really shifted. Also get Ben Evan's numbers on how much online has really eaten vs creating.)

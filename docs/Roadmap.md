# Music Lessons - Roadmap

## Draft the thesis on one page

As per Sam A's suggestion, distil what I am saying onto one page. Reread this often.

[ ] Draft on one page
[ ] Get feedback from people - post this on LT/twitter/TT
[ ] Update from feedback

## PART Zero

I need a section which gives the reason for wanting to read this. I'll revisit this later. 


This can also be used for the landing page.

Tasks:
[ ] Find recent historical examples where the ideas in this book would be useful.
[ ] Find examples in the future where these examples would be useful
[ ] Draft this chapter
[ ] Share on social - post to blog. Share on LT/TT/twitter
[ ] Pod: find people to talk about each of the examples (Add these as tasks to the roadmap)
[ ] Promo: are there any conferences relevant to this?
[ ] Publishers: who is publishing the books on this (in other industries)? Which organisations (e.g. RSA) are involved?
[ ] Blog post summary: examples / where to look etc

## PART 1: WINDOWS & STRUCTURES

Questions I have (to share on social):
[ ]


[ ] Write blog posts of my thoughts on this

[ ] Start with the typical picture of the music industry - find the main texts on music industry history. These will probably start around Queen Anne / copyright or 1900s.
[ ] Has anyone else made my point?
[ ] I think there's another name for 'windows'. Framing? Selective with data? Research this. This should lead to some other examples.

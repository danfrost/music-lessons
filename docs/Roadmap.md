Tabi: I have a friend who does lots of things about open resources and communication specialist type stuff (don't fully understand it all) but he might be useful for your book thing. He is on twitter Sam moore. I'll find a link

[ ] Wait for feedback (give it a week)
[ ] Plan how I'm going to get feedback as I go - update NI social 
    plan to focus on this (remove any other fluff)
[ ] Update from feedback

## PART Zero

I need a section which gives the reason for wanting to read this. I'll revisit this later. 

This can also be used for the landing page.

Tasks:
[#NEXT] Find recent historical examples where the ideas in this book would be useful.
[ ] Find examples in the future where these examples would be useful
[ ] Draft this chapter
[ ] Share on social - post to blog. Share on LT/TT/twitter
[ ] Pod: find people to talk about each of the examples (Add these as tasks to the roadmap)
[ ] Promo: are there any conferences relevant to this?
[ ] Publishers: who is publishing the books on this (in other industries)? Which organisations (e.g. RSA) are involved?
[ ] Blog post summary: examples / where to look etc

## PART 1: WINDOWS & STRUCTURES

### Part 1.1  - Windows hide the truth

Questions I have (to share on social):
[ ] What are systematic ways we have of controlling / changing the truth?
[ ] What myths are true in the short term but wrong in the long term?
[ ] What systems (industries) feel eternal / fundamental but aren't that old?
[ ]

Tasks:
[ ] Write blog posts of my thoughts on this
[ ] Start with the typical picture of the music industry - find the main texts on music industry history. These will probably start around Queen Anne / copyright or 1900s.
[ ] Has anyone else made my point?
[ ] I think there's another name for 'windows'. Framing? Selective with data? Research this. This should lead to some other examples.
